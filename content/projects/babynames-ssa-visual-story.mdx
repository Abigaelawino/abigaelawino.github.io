title: How Basic Is Your Name? SSA Baby Names Visual Story
date: 2026-02-16
tags: [analytics, visualization, storytelling]
summary: A visual exploration of U.S. baby names by generation using SSA data, Tableau, and Python data prep.
caseStudyData: Aggregated 145 SSA text files into a 2,149,477-row dataset spanning 1880–2024 with no missing values across name, sex, count, and year.
caseStudyMethods: Cleaned and normalized SSA name records with pandas, derived decade and generation cohorts, and built Tableau visuals for top-10 trends and cohort comparisons. Exported assets for shareable storytelling.
caseStudyResults: Delivered a multi-panel visual story showing top-10 names across Lost, Greatest, Silent, Boomers, Gen X, Millennials, Gen Z, and Gen Alpha with cohort-level comparisons and gender splits.
caseStudyReproducibility: Python notebooks cover data ingestion and cleanup. Tableau dashboards can be rebuilt from the exported CSV outputs.
caseStudyReflection: The biggest insight was how sharply naming trends shift at cohort boundaries. Next iteration could add regional slices and socioeconomic covariates.

- Deliverables and assets

## Highlights

- **Generational cohorts** with top-10 names per cohort
- **Trend shifts** from Boomers to Gen Alpha
- **Tableau visuals** optimized for storytelling

## Data Snapshot

- **Rows:** 2,149,477 baby-name records
- **Coverage:** 1880–2024 (145 years)
- **Nulls:** 0 missing values across core fields

- **Gender distribution:** 1,263,426 female rows vs 886,051 male rows
- **Unisex list:** Jessie, Riley, Casey, Jackie, Johnnie, Peyton, Dakota, Jaime lead balanced usage

## Notebook Snippets

```python
# Concatenate yearly SSA files into a single dataset
dfs = [pd.read_csv(path, names=["name", "sex", "count"], header=None) for path in files]
for year, df in zip(years, dfs):
    df["year"] = year
babynames = pd.concat(dfs, ignore_index=True)
```

```python
# Generation buckets (Tableau-compatible)
babynames["generation"] = np.select(
    [
        babynames["year"].between(1883, 1900),
        babynames["year"].between(1901, 1927),
        babynames["year"].between(1928, 1945),
        babynames["year"].between(1946, 1964),
        babynames["year"].between(1965, 1980),
        babynames["year"].between(1981, 1996),
        babynames["year"].between(1997, 2012),
        babynames["year"].between(2013, 2024),
    ],
    ["Lost", "Greatest", "Silent", "Boomers", "Gen X", "Millennials", "Gen Z", "Gen Alpha"],
    default="Other",
)
```

```python
# Generation ranges used for cohort comparisons
generation_ranges = {
    "Lost Generation": (1883, 1900),
    "Greatest Generation": (1901, 1927),
    "Silent Generation": (1928, 1945),
    "Baby Boomers": (1946, 1964),
    "Generation X": (1965, 1980),
    "Millennials (Gen Y)": (1981, 1996),
    "Generation Z": (1997, 2012),
    "Generation Alpha": (2013, 2024),
}
```

## Tableau Workbook Details

- **Calculated fields:** `Decade = INT(FLOOR([year] / 10) * 10)` and `Generation` buckets
- **Generations:** Lost, Greatest, Silent, Boomers, Gen X, Millennials, Gen Z, Gen Alpha
- **Sheets:** Top 10 Boy/Girl names by generation with linked highlights
- **Color mapping:** `F` to #e14f7a and `M` to #a0cbe8 for consistent gender encoding

### Sheet Inventory

- Top 10 Boy Names — Boomers, Gen X, Millennials, Gen Z, Gen Alpha
- Top 10 Girl Names — Boomers, Gen X, Millennials, Gen Z, Gen Alpha

## Visualizations
