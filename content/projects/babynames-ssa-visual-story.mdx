title: How Basic Is Your Name? SSA Baby Names Visual Story
date: 2026-02-16
tags: [analytics, visualization, storytelling]
summary: A visual exploration of U.S. baby names by generation using SSA data, Tableau, and Python data prep.
caseStudyData: Aggregated SSA baby names data (1880–2024) from SSA text files into a single cleaned dataset. Focused on names with at least 5 occurrences per year and grouped records into generational cohorts.
caseStudyMethods: Cleaned and normalized SSA name records with pandas, derived generational cohorts, and built Tableau visuals for top-10 trends and cohort comparisons. Exported assets for shareable storytelling.
caseStudyResults: Delivered a multi-panel visual story showing top-10 names across Boomers, Gen X, Millennials, Gen Z, and Gen Alpha with cohort-level comparisons.
caseStudyReproducibility: Python notebooks cover data ingestion and cleanup. Tableau dashboards can be rebuilt from the exported CSV outputs.
caseStudyReflection: The biggest insight was how sharply naming trends shift at cohort boundaries. Next iteration could add regional slices and socioeconomic covariates.
