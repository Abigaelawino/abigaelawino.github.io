title: F5 Breach 2025 — Difference-in-Differences Analysis
date: 2026-02-16
tags: [causal-inference, analytics, finance]
summary: A Difference-in-Differences analysis of the October 2025 F5 Networks breach and its causal impact on stock returns.
caseStudyData: Pulled daily stock prices for FFIV and peer/benchmark tickers with `yfinance` for 2025-04-18 to 2025-12-12. Event date: 2025-10-16.
caseStudyMethods: Computed daily returns and estimated a DiD model with treated, post, and treated-post interaction terms. Validated assumptions with parallel-trends checks, placebo tests, and difference-in-trends robustness.
caseStudyResults: Estimated a ~9–10% additional drop in FFIV daily returns after the breach relative to peers (treated_post ≈ -0.095, p < 0.001).
caseStudyReproducibility: The repo includes data collection functions, model scripts, and visualization outputs for replication.
caseStudyReflection: The strongest signal came from the treated-post coefficient. Next iteration should add volatility/volume effects and intraday data.
