title: Support Ticket NLP Triage
date: 2025-09-18
tags: [ml, nlp, analytics]
summary: Automated support ticket categorization and urgency scoring to speed up SLA routing.
caseStudyData: Built a labeled corpus from historical support tickets, policy metadata, and escalation outcomes, with PII redaction and language normalization pre-processing.
caseStudyMethods: Fine-tuned a transformer classifier for intent and urgency, calibrated probabilities, and added rule-based safeguards for critical keywords.
caseStudyResults: Increased first-pass routing accuracy to 87 percent and cut median triage time from 22 minutes to under 6 minutes for inbound queues.
caseStudyReproducibility: Project ships containerized inference service, model version manifests, and evaluation scripts for deterministic benchmark reruns.
caseStudyReflection: A stronger active-learning loop with agent feedback would improve long-tail categories and reduce annotation drift.

# Support Ticket NLP Triage

This case study covers text preprocessing, model serving, and calibration for human-in-the-loop triage.
