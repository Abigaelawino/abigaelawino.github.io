tags: [ml, nlp, analytics]
summary: Automated support ticket categorization and urgency scoring to speed up SLA routing for enterprise support operations.
caseStudyData: Assembled a labeled corpus of 150,000+ historical support tickets spanning 3 years of operations, including ticket content, policy metadata, resolution times, and escalation outcomes. Performed comprehensive preprocessing including PII redaction using spaCy's NER models, language normalization with contractions expansion, and text standardization. Created hierarchical taxonomy with 25 categories and 5 urgency levels through iterative stakeholder validation.
caseStudyMethods: Fine-tuned DistilBERT-base-uncased transformer model on custom dataset for multi-label classification combining intent detection and urgency scoring. Implemented Platt scaling for probability calibration and added ensemble approach combining transformer predictions with rule-based safeguards for critical keywords and SLA violations. Developed active learning pipeline to continuously improve model performance with agent feedback loops. Deployed via FastAPI service with batch processing capabilities and real-time inference endpoints.
caseStudyResults: Achieved 87% first-pass routing accuracy (up from 64% baseline) and reduced median triage time from 22 minutes to under 6 minutes for inbound queues. Model correctly identified 95% of critical tickets requiring escalation while reducing false positives by 42%. System saved approximately 180 agent hours per month and improved customer satisfaction scores by 15% points in the first quarter. Successfully scaled to handle 10,000+ daily tickets with sub-second inference times.
caseStudyReproducibility: Complete reproducible environment provided through Docker containers with pinned dependency versions. Model version manifests include training hyperparameters, data splits, and evaluation metrics. Comprehensive test suite covering unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end pipeline validation. Benchmarks can be reproduced deterministically using provided scripts and sample datasets. Monitoring dashboard tracks model drift and performance degradation over time.
caseStudyReflection: The project revealed the critical importance of human-AI collaboration in maintaining classification quality. Initial model performance plateaued until implementing active learning with agent feedback. A stronger continuous learning pipeline would better handle concept drift as customer issues evolve. Future iterations should explore multi-modal approaches incorporating screenshots and logs, and implement better explainability features for agent trust. Key learning was balancing automation speed with accuracy - overly aggressive automation led to agent frustration and override rates above 30%.
