date: 2026-02-16
tags: [llm, nlp, rag]
summary: A conversational RAG system built with LangChain, Redis vector store, and OpenAI models.
caseStudyData: Seeded sample documents and embeddings in Redis, plus chat history storage for multi-turn conversations.
caseStudyMethods: Implemented a ConversationalRetrievalChain with Redis-backed memory and vector search. Integrated GPT-4o-mini for response generation.
caseStudyResults: Delivered a working CLI chatbot that retrieves relevant context and maintains conversation state across turns.
caseStudyReproducibility: Repo includes requirements, configuration notes, and runnable examples for recreating the RAG workflow.
caseStudyReflection: Retrieval quality is highly sensitive to chunking and embedding configuration. Next step is automated eval harnesses.

# LangChain with Redis — RAG Tutorial

This project demonstrates a conversational RAG workflow using LangChain, Redis vector search, and OpenAI models.

## What’s Included

- Redis vector store retrieval
- Chat history memory in Redis
- CLI interface for interactive testing

## Architecture Snapshot

1. Load environment variables (OpenAI + Redis credentials).
2. Build embeddings and index documents in Redis.
3. Use `ConversationalRetrievalChain` for retrieval + memory.
4. Serve responses via a simple CLI loop.
