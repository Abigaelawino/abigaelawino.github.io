title: Customer Churn Risk Modeling
date: 2026-01-12
tags: [ml, analytics, time-series]
summary: Built a churn risk model and dashboard to prioritize retention outreach.
caseStudyData: Combined 24 months of CRM activity, subscription transactions, and support logs; standardized IDs and imputed sparse engagement fields before modeling.
caseStudyMethods: Trained gradient-boosted trees with recency-frequency features, compared against logistic regression baseline, and tuned thresholding for retention team capacity.
caseStudyResults: Improved top-decile churn capture by 31 percent over baseline and reduced wasted outreach by focusing account-manager effort on high-risk cohorts.
caseStudyReproducibility: Repository includes pinned dependencies, SQL feature extraction scripts, and notebook-to-pipeline parity checks for repeatable training runs.
caseStudyReflection: Next iteration should add causal uplift testing to separate true intervention impact from naturally reactivating customers.
