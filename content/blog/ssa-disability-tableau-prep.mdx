# Preparing SSA Disability Data for Tableau (FY2001–FY2021)

The SSA dataset arrives with mixed data types, wide columns, and date formatting inconsistencies. This post summarizes the cleaning steps I used before visualization.

## Cleaning Steps

- Standardized numeric fields (removed commas and cast to numeric)
- Parsed update dates into a consistent format
- Constructed `State-FY` keys for easy map and filter usage

## Output

The result is a Tableau-ready CSV (`ssa_disability_tableau_ready.csv`) with:

- 1,092 rows
- 30 fields
- FY2001–FY2021 coverage

This file drives the choropleth map and ranking charts in the project.
