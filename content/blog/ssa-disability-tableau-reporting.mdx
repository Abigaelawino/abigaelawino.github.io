# SSA Disability Outcomes — Tableau Reporting Notes

This step produces a Tableau‑ready export and defines the fields used in the choropleth.

## Tableau Prep

- Added `State-FY` key for stable joins
- Reordered columns to keep high‑value metrics first
- Exported `ssa_disability_tableau_ready.csv`

## Reporting Choices

- Choropleth uses **favorable determination rate**
- Ranking tables highlight top/bottom states
- FY2021 is the default map view for reporting
