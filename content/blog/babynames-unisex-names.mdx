# Unisex Baby Names: Balancing Female vs Male Usage

The Baby Names project surfaces a set of names that show meaningful balance between female and male usage. Rather than highlight one-year spikes, I used the full historical counts to avoid noisy conclusions.

## Balanced Names (Top Examples)

- Jessie (F: 169,704 | M: 111,202)
- Riley (F: 137,477 | M: 103,344)
- Casey (F: 77,869 | M: 115,589)
- Jackie (F: 91,167 | M: 78,836)
- Johnnie (F: 49,154 | M: 102,028)

## Chart Rationale

I used a grouped bar chart to show female vs male totals side-by-side. It keeps the comparison immediate and avoids confusion when the gap is narrow.

## What I’d Add Next

- Highlight shifts in balance over time (e.g., when a name flips gender dominance)
- Add regional filters to see localized patterns
