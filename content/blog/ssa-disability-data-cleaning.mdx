# SSA Disability Outcomes — Cleaning and Type Fixes

Raw SSA tables contain numeric fields stored as strings and occasional formatting artifacts. This step normalizes data types so calculations are reliable.

## Key Fixes

- **Numeric columns:** Removed commas and cast to numeric
- **Required fields:** Dropped rows missing eligible population fields
- **Data types:** Verified 30 columns with consistent dtypes

## Why This Matters

Approval rates and filing rates are computed fields. If source columns are not numeric, those rates become incorrect or missing.
