# F5 Breach: Validating DiD Assumptions and Placebo Tests

Difference-in-Differences only works if the treated and control series behave similarly **before** the event. This post summarizes the quick checks I used to validate the setup.

## Parallel Trends Check

I compared the pre-breach trend of FFIV returns against a basket of peer/benchmark tickers. The lack of a pre-event slope shift supported the DiD setup.

## Placebo Test

I shifted the event date one week earlier and re-estimated the model. The placebo interaction was effectively zero (`treated_post ≈ 0.0042`), which increases confidence that the real event drove the observed effect.

## Takeaway

The strongest evidence still comes from the main DiD interaction (`treated_post ≈ -0.0951`), but the placebo check and trend test make the story defensible.
