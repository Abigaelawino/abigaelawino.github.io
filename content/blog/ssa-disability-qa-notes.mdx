# QA Notes on SSA Disability Approval Rates (FY2021)

When approval-rate visuals are used in policy contexts, a quick QA pass is essential. Here’s the checklist I used before publishing the FY2021 map and rankings.

## QA Checklist

- Confirm fiscal year filter = FY2021
- Validate state count = 52 (including DC)
- Spot-check top/bottom states for outliers
- Verify rate fields are numeric and within 0–100

## FY2021 Snapshot

- **Highest approval rates:** KS, AK, NH, NE, RI
- **Lowest approval rates:** DC, OK, MS, WV, IN

This QA pass keeps the map trustworthy and avoids misleading readers.
