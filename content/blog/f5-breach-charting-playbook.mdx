# Charting the F5 Breach Impact for Stakeholders

This analysis needed to be understood in seconds. I built a small set of charts that move from signal to interpretation without overwhelming the reader.

## 1) Returns Around the Event

A simple line chart of FFIV daily returns around the breach date makes the immediate impact visible.

## 2) DiD Coefficients

I used a coefficient bar chart to show the interaction term alongside the treated and post controls. It keeps focus on the size and direction of the breach effect.

## 3) Robustness Story

The placebo and trend checks are summarized in plain language, with the key numbers highlighted. This keeps the slide deck tight without burying assumptions.

## Outcome

This structure let non-technical stakeholders validate the story quickly and still gave analysts enough detail to trust the results.
