# Building the SSA Baby Names Data Pipeline (1880–2024)

This post documents the exact ingestion and cleanup steps behind the Baby Names visual story. The goal was a single, tidy table that could drive both Python analysis and Tableau dashboards without manual fixes.

## Source Files

- 145 SSA text files (1880–2024)
- Fields: name, sex, count, year
- Minimum count per name-year enforced by SSA source

## Core Cleaning Decisions

- Concatenated all yearly files into one dataset
- Standardized column names and data types
- Validated categorical values for `sex` (F, M)
- Ensured no missing values across core fields

## Output Snapshot

- **Rows:** 2,149,477
- **Years:** 1880–2024
- **Nulls:** 0 missing across core fields

## Why This Matters for Viz

Once the data was flat and consistent, it became trivial to generate:

- Year-over-year birth counts
- Generation-based top-10 lists
- Gender split comparisons

If you want to reproduce the pipeline, the notebook in the repo walks through every step and includes the final CSV export.
