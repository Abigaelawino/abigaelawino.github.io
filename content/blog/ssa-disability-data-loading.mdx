# SSA Disability Outcomes — Data Loading Walkthrough

This post documents the first step in the SSA disability outcomes workflow: loading the raw dataset and validating its basic structure before any transformations.

## What’s Loaded

- **File:** SSA-SA-FYWL.csv
- **Scope:** State‑level fiscal year records
- **Fields:** 30 columns covering populations, filings, determinations, and rates

## Quick Validation

The notebook immediately checks:

- File presence + basic shape
- Column headers
- First rows to confirm expected values

## Why This Matters

If the load step is wrong, every downstream chart and model is wrong. This pass ensures we’re working with expected fields and a stable schema.
