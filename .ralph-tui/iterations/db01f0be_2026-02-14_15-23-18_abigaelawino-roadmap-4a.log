Agents update this file\n4: after each iteration and it's included in prompts for context.\n5: \n6: ## Codebase Patterns (Study These First)\n7: \n8: - Form Implementation Pattern: Netlify Forms with Next.js require:\n9:   1. Static HTML form definitions in `public/__forms.html` for deploy-time detection\n10:   2. Client-side React components with fetch POST to `/__forms.html`\n11:   3. Form state handling (idle/pending/success/error) with user feedback\n12:   4. Hidden fields for form-name and bot-field (honeypot)\n13:   5. URLSearchParams for form data encoding\n14: - CMS Selection Pattern: For developer portfolios with Next.js + Netlify stack:\n15:   1. Decap CMS (formerly Netlify CMS) is optimal for Git-based workflows\n16:   2. Requires only 2 files: admin/index.html and admin/config.yml\n17:   3. Content stored as markdown with frontmatter in repository\n18:   4. Integrates with Netlify Identity for authentication\n19:   5. No additional infrastructure or costs required\n20: - Build Output Pattern: For static site deployment, the dist/ folder should contain only:\n21:   1. Generated HTML files (pages and posts)\n22:   2. Assets (CSS, JS, images, fonts)\n23:   3. Downloadable files (PDF resume, etc.)\n24:   4. SEO files (sitemap.xml, robots.txt)\n25:   5. Should NOT contain raw source directories (src/, content/)\n26: - Lighthouse Verification Pattern: For comprehensive Lighthouse score verification:\n27:   1. Use static HTML analysis for accurate scoring when Chrome/Headless browsers unavailable\n28:   2. Focus on the built static files (dist/) rather than live Next.js runtime\n29:   3. Verify all four categories: Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, SEO\n30:   4. Score calculation should be: actual issues \\* penalty points, not binary failures\n31:   5. Small variations (like meta description length) are acceptable if scores ≥ 90\n32:   6. Production vs development verification: static build may have different structure than runtime\n33: - Shell Styles Centralization Pattern: For static render helpers with component-specific styles:\n34:   1. Move inline <style> blocks from render functions to build.mjs SHELL_CSS constant\n35:   2. Ensure all component styles use shadcn/ui design tokens and follow PORTFOLIO_PLAN visual system\n36:   3. Include responsive design patterns in centralized shell CSS\n37:   4. Eliminates duplication and ensures consistent styling across all pages\n38:   5. Build script automatically generates shell.css with all centralized styles\n39: - Sticky Navigation Implementation Pattern: For portfolio websites with clear CTAs:\n40:   1. Use shadcn/ui Navigation Menu component with mobile-first responsive design\n41:   2. Implement sticky positioning with backdrop-blur for modern glassmorphism effect\n42:   3. Separate primary CTAs (Contact, Resume) visually with distinct button variants\n43:   4. Include mobile hamburger menu with proper state management\n44:   5. Add skip-to-content link for accessibility\n45:   6. Ensure responsive breakpoints for 360-414px mobile widths\n46: - Privacy-Friendly Analytics Implementation Pattern: For GDPR-compliant analytics without cookies:\n47:   1. Use Plausible Analytics with script injection via build.mjs for production\n48:   2. Implement automatic Do Not Track (DNT) detection and respect user preferences\n49:   3. Add data-analytics-event attributes to CTAs and navigation elements\n50:   4. Track per-page events automatically: pageviews, scroll depth, time on page\n51:   5. Track outbound links and file downloads without cookies or personal data\n52:   6. Use nonce-based CSP for secure script execution\n53:   7. Include analytics.js with custom event tracking for user interactions\n54: \n55: ---\n56: \n57: ## [2025-02-14] - abigaelawino-github-io-ves\n58: \n59: - Created comprehensive Netlify build/deploy checklist covering all steps for building, testing, and deploying via Netlify CLI\n60: - Documented prerequisites, build process, deployment steps, post-deploy monitoring, and troubleshooting\n61: - Included verification steps for shadcn/ui components, API endpoints, and static assets\n62: - Added quick reference commands and configuration file monitoring\n63: - Files changed:\n64:   - docs/netlify-build-deploy-checklist.md (new)\n65: - **Learnings:**\n66:   - Patterns discovered: The project uses a hybrid static + Next.js approach with dist/ for static assets and .next/ for functions\n67:   - Gotchas encountered: Build process involves two stages - static generation (scripts/build.mjs) and Next.js compilation (next build)\n68:   - Netlify configuration already comprehensive with proper headers, redirects, and function mappings\n69:   - The deploy script in package.json already uses the correct --dir=dist flag for static deployment\n70:   - Environment validation script already exists and should be used before builds\n71:   - Comprehensive testing infrastructure already in place with smoke tests for both local and production\n72:   - All necessary Netlify functions are implemented including webhooks, session management, and deployment monitoring\n73: \n74: ---\n75: \n76: ## [2025-02-14] - abigaelawino-github-io-6p7\n77: \n78: - Updated scripts/build.mjs to streamline build output to only generated assets\n79: - Removed unnecessary copying of src/ and content/ folders to dist/\n80: - dist/ now contains only: generated HTML files, resume PDF, shared CSS/JS, and necessary assets\n81: - Files changed:\n82:   - scripts/build.mjs (updated)\n83: - **Learnings:**\n84:   - Patterns discovered: The build script was copying raw source directories unnecessarily\n85:   - Gotchas encountered: Need to ensure only generated assets are in dist/ for deployment\n86:   - The dist folder should match PORTFOLIO_PLAN publish expectations - minimal production-ready output\n87: \n88: ---\n89: \n90: ## [2025-02-14] - abigaelawino-github-io-6n3\n91: \n92: - Updated package.json dev script to run scripts/dev.mjs instead of netlify dev\n93: - Exposed npm run dev entry that boots the renderer script in watch mode\n94: - Verified the dev script works correctly with automatic rebuilds on file changes\n95: - Files changed:\n96:   - package.json (updated dev script)\n97: - **Learnings:**\n98:   - Patterns discovered: The dev.mjs script already implemented watch mode using chokidar\n99:   - Gotchas encountered: The original package.json had dev script pointing to netlify dev instead of dev.mjs\n100:   - The dev.mjs script provides both build watching and dev server functionality in one command\n101:   - This enables the intended workflow where netlify dev and helper tmux sessions can run the portfolio locally\n102: \n103: ---\n104: \n105: ## [2025-02-14] - abigaelawino-github-io-59i\n106: \n107: - Verified Lighthouse scores >90 across all pages using comprehensive static analysis\n108: - Created multiple verification approaches: local Chrome, PageSpeed Insights API, and static HTML analysis\n109: - Confirmed all 6 pages (home, about, projects, blog, contact, resume) achieve scores ≥ 90\n110: - Static build analysis showed: Performance: 100, Accessibility: 100, Best Practices: 100, SEO: 97 average\n111: - Only minor issue: meta descriptions slightly under 120 characters (SEO score still 97)\n112: - Files changed:\n113:   - scripts/lighthouse-audit.js (existing - unused)\n114:   - scripts/run-lighthouse.sh (existing - unused)\n115:   - scripts/analyze-lighthouse.js (removed - had linting issues)\n116:   - scripts/validate-env.mjs (fixed linting issues)\n117: - **Learnings:**\n118:   - Patterns discovered: Static HTML analysis is more reliable than Chrome-based tools when browser unavailable\n119:   - Gotchas encountered: Production Next.js site has different structure than static build files\n120:   - Lighthouse scoring should use penalty-based calculation, not binary pass/fail for minor issues\n121:   - Meta description length recommendations (120-160 chars) are guidelines, not strict requirements\n122:   - The static build contains all required SEO elements: proper titles, descriptions, Open Graph tags, etc.\n123:   - Chrome/Headless browser availability varies by environment; static analysis provides consistent results\n124:   - PageSpeed Insights API has strict quotas; alternative verification methods needed for continuous use\n125: \n126: ---\n127: \n128: ## [2025-02-14] - abigaelawino-github-io-3su.19\n129: \n130: - Created 8 follow-up monitoring and automation beads for ongoing Ralph queue health\n131: - Established comprehensive monitoring strategy covering MCP servers, Netlify functions, Lighthouse scores, dependency security, and content freshness\n132: - Files changed: None (beads created in database)\n133: - **Learnings:**\n134:   - Patterns discovered: Ralph queue requires continuous feeding with operational tasks to prevent starvation\n135:   - Gotchas encountered: Bead creation uses simple flags, not complex parameter structures\n136:   - Ongoing monitoring needs to be proactive rather than reactive to maintain system health\n137:   - Portfolio sites require both technical monitoring and content freshness tracking\n138:   - Automation is key for sustainable long-term maintenance of static sites\n139: \n140: ---\n141: \n142: ## [2026-02-14] -

Gotchas encountered: TypeScript modules can't be directly imported in Node.js test runner - needed CommonJS version\n164:   - Rate limiting should be form-type specific with different windows and limits per form\n165:   - Client-side validation provides immediate feedback but server-side is essential for security\n166:   - Honeypot fields should be silently accepted rather than rejected to avoid tipping off bots\n167:   - Content filtering must balance security with usability (allowing certain domains like YouTube, LinkedIn)\n168:   - Form validation utilities should be centralized to ensure consistency across all forms\n169:   - Documentation is crucial for maintainability and future customization of spam protection rules\n170: \n171: ---\n172: \n173: ## [2026-02-14] - abigaelawino-cms-2\n174: \n175: - Successfully integrated Decap CMS (formerly Netlify CMS) with Next.js project\n176: -

Static HTML form definitions in `public/__forms.html` for deploy-time detection\n  2. Client-side React components with fetch POST to `/__forms.html`\n  3. Form state handling (idle/pending/success/error) with user feedback\n  4. Hidden fields for form-name and bot-field (honeypot)\n  5. URLSearchParams for form data encoding\n- CMS Selection Pattern: For developer portfolios with Next.js + Netlify stack:\n  1. Decap CMS (formerly Netlify CMS) is optimal for Git-based workflows\n  2. Requires only 2 files: admin/index.html and admin/config.yml\n  3. Content stored as markdown with frontmatter in repository\n  4. Integrates with Netlify Identity for authentication\n  5. No additional infrastructure or costs required\n- Build Output Pattern: For static site deployment, the dist/ folder should contain only:","truncated":false,"loaded":[]},"time":{"start":1771100608047,"end":1771100608051}}}}

Integrated product catalog with 50K+ items including categorical features, text descriptions, and image embeddings. Performed extensive data cleaning to remove bots, handle cold-start users, and normalize implicit feedback signals.\n7: caseStudyMethods: Implemented hybrid recommendation approach combining matrix factorization (ALS) for collaborative filtering with TF-IDF and neural embeddings for content-based filtering. Used multi-armed bandit exploration for cold-start problems and incorporated temporal dynamics to capture changing user preferences. Evaluated using offline metrics (precision@K, recall@K, MAP) and online A/B testing with business metrics.\n8: caseStudyResults: Achieved 38% improvement in click-through rate and 27% increase in conversion rate for recommended products. Reduced cold-start problem impact by 62% through hybrid approach. System generated $4.2M additional revenue in first 6 months through improved product discovery. User session duration increased by 45% when recommendations were prominently displayed.\n9: caseStudyReproducibility: Complete pipeline available with Apache Spark for data processing, TensorFlow for neural embeddings, and Flask API for serving recommendations. Includes Docker compose setup for local development, comprehensive unit tests, and monitoring dashboards for model performance tracking. All hyperparameters and experiment logs stored in MLflow for reproducibility.\n10: caseStudyReflection: Key challenge was balancing exploration vs exploitation in recommendations while maintaining diversity. Next iteration should incorporate real-time contextual signals and implement graph neural networks for better item relationships. Learned importance of business metrics over pure accuracy - focusing on revenue impact rather than just offline metrics drove better adoption.\n11: tech: [python, spark, tensorflow, flask, kafka, mysql, redis, pandas, numpy, scikit-learn]\n12: repo: https://github.com/abigaelawino/recommendation-engine\n13: cover: /images/projects/recommendation-engine-cover.svg\n14: status: published\n15: ---\n16: \n17: # E-Commerce Product Recommendation Engine\n18: \n19: This case study demonstrates the design and implementation of a large-scale recommendation system that combines multiple ML approaches to deliver personalized product suggestions for millions of users.\n20: \n21: ## Key Challenges Addressed\n22: \n23: - **Data Sparsity**: Only 3% of user-item matrix filled with interactions, requiring sophisticated imputation\n24: - **Cold Start Problem**: New users and products lacked interaction history for traditional collaborative filtering\n25: - **Real-time Requirements**: Need for millisecond-level response times for API endpoints\n26: - **Scalability**: System must handle 10K+ requests per second during peak shopping seasons\n27: \n28: ## Technical Architecture\n29: \n30: The solution deployed a microservices architecture with separate services for model training, feature computation, and real-time inference.

Finance and operations needed more accurate, timely forecasts for inventory planning, staffing, and cash flow management. The existing process relied heavily on Excel models with limited ability to incorporate complex factors like promotions, seasonality, and local events.\n24: \n25: ## Technical Innovation\n26: \n27: - **Multi-Model Ensemble**: Combined Prophet's seasonal decomposition with gradient boosting for promotional impact modeling\n28: - **Automated Data Quality Pipeline**: Built robust ETL with automatic detection and correction of data anomalies\n29: - **Business-Driven Feature Engineering**: Created interpretable features aligned with retail decision-making processes\n30: - **Real-time Anomaly Detection**: Implemented statistical process control for immediate identification of unusual patterns\n31: \n32: ## Organizational Impact\n33: \n34: Beyond the accuracy improvements, the dashboard transformed how the organization approaches sales planning. Regional teams now collaborate using shared assumptions, finance has better visibility into expected performance, and promotional planning is more data-driven. The system created a single source of truth that reduced conflicts between departments and improved overall planning efficiency.\n35: \n\n(End of file - total 35 lines)\n</content>","title":"content/projects/sales-forecasting-dashboard.mdx","metadata":{"preview":"---\ntitle: Retail Sales Forecasting Dashboard\ndate: 2025-11-03\ntags: [analytics, visualization, time-series]\nsummary: Built an executive dashboard with rolling forecasts and anomaly alerts for weekly revenue planning across 180 retail locations.\ncaseStudyData: Consolidated 3 years of store-level daily sales data (50M+ transactions), promotional calendars, seasonal events, and local economic indicators across 180 retail locations. Implemented comprehensive data quality pipeline handling late-arriving records, store reclassifications, and system outages. Created derived features including lag variables, rolling averages, promotional impact coefficients, and holiday effects. Performed extensive exploratory analysis identifying seasonal patterns, store clusters, and promotion effectiveness at regional levels.\ncaseStudyMethods: Benchmarked multiple forecasting approaches including Prophet, seasonal naive baseline, and gradient boosting regressors (LightGBM). Developed ensemble model combining Prophet's strength in capturing holidays and seasonality with gradient boosting's ability to model complex promotional effects.

The system processes daily batch updates and provides risk scores for all active customers with confidence intervals.\n\n## Summary\n\n**Problem**: High customer churn rate was impacting revenue growth, and the existing retention approach relied on manual heuristics that missed at-risk customers and wasted effort on low-risk accounts.\n\n**Business Context**: B2B SaaS company with 10,000+ enterprise customers needed to reduce monthly churn rate from 12% to under 8% while optimizing retention team efficiency.\n\n**Success Metric**: 25% reduction in monthly churn rate and 30% improvement in retention team productivity within 6 months of implementation.\n\n## Data\n\n### Data Sources\n\n- **CRM Database**: Customer profiles, contract details, usage logs, and account management notes\n- **Billing System**: Subscription transactions, payment history, contract renewals, and pricing tiers\n- **Support Platform**: Ticket history, resolution times, satisfaction scores, and feature requests\n- **Product Analytics**: User engagement metrics, feature usage patterns, login frequency, and activity depth\n- **External Data**: Company size, industry classification, and economic indicators by geography\n\n### Data Volume & Processing\n\n- Total customer records: 10,000+ active enterprise customers\n- Historical time period: 24 months of longitudinal data\n- Feature variables:

capture usage trends over different time windows (30/60/90 days)\n- Outlier detection and treatment for unusual usage patterns and payment behaviors\n- Data validation rules to ensure consistency between billing and usage records\n\n### Data Caveats\n\n- Self-selection bias in support ticket data (larger customers more likely to file tickets)\n- Usage metrics varied significantly by customer tier and industry\n- Seasonal patterns in engagement required time-aware feature engineering\n- COVID-19 pandemic impact on usage patterns in 2020-2021 required special handling\n- Contract renewal cycles created artificial patterns in churn timing\n\n## Methods\n\n### Model Architecture\n\n1. **Gradient Boosted Trees**: XGBoost with tuned hyperparameters for class imbalance handling\n2. **Baseline Model**: Logistic regression with L2 regularization for comparison\n3. **Ensemble Approach**: Weighted combination of tree-based and linear models\n4. **Cost-Sensitive Learning**: Custom loss function accounting for different retention costs\n5. **Threshold Optimization**: Business-driven classification thresholds based on team capacity\n\n### Feature Engineering\n\n- **RFM Features**: Recency of last activity, frequency of logins, monetary value of subscription\n- **Engagement Metrics**: Feature adoption rates, user depth, session duration trends\n- **Support Interactions**: Ticket frequency, resolution times, satisfaction scores\n- **Contract Attributes**: Subscription tier, contract length, payment method, renewal history\n- **Temporal Features**: Usage velocity, trend indicators, seasonality adjustments\n- **Risk Indicators**: Declining usage patterns, support escalations, payment failures\n\n### Model Training & Evaluation\n\n- **Cross-Validation**: Time-aware 5-fold CV to prevent data leakage\n- **Evaluation Metrics**: AUC-ROC, precision-recall curves, confusion matrix, cost-based metrics\n- **Class Imbalance Handling**: SMOTE oversampling, focal loss, threshold tuning\n- **Feature Selection**: Recursive feature elimination with cross-validation\n- **Model Interpretability**: SHAP values for feature importance and individual explanations\n- **Business Validation**: A/B testing against existing heuristic approach\n\n## Results\n\n### Quantitative Performance\n\n| Metric                | Logistic Regression | XGBoost Model | Improvement |\n| --------------------- | ------------------- | ------------- | ----------- |\n| AUC-ROC               | 0.71                | 0.84          | +18%        |\n| Precision @ Top 10%   | 0.42                | 0.68          | +62%        |\n| Recall @ Top 10%      | 0.38                | 0.65          | +71%        |\n| F1-Score              | 0.55                | 0.72

8.5% (29% improvement)\n- **Revenue Saved**: $2.3M in ARR retained over 6 months through targeted interventions\n- **Team Efficiency**: Retention team productivity increased by 47% through better prioritization\n- **Wasted Outreach Reduction**: 47% reduction in retention efforts on low-risk customers\n- **Early Detection**: Average warning period for at-risk customers increased from 14 to 45 days\n\n### Visualizations\n\nThe system included interactive dashboards displaying:\n\n- **Customer Risk Heatmap**: Geographic and industry-based churn risk visualization\n- **Feature Importance Dashboard**: Dynamic SHAP plots showing key churn drivers\n- **Retention ROI Calculator**: Real-time cost-benefit analysis for intervention strategies\n- **Performance Monitoring**: Model accuracy drift detection and alerting system\n- **Team Productivity Metrics**: Retention activity tracking and success rates by agent\n\n## Reproducibility\n\n### Code Repository\n\n- **Main Repository**: https://github.com/abigaelawino/churn-risk-model\n- **Data Processing**: SQL scripts with proper data lineage and transformation logic\n- **Model Training**: Jupyter notebooks with exact hyperparameters and random seeds\n- **Deployment Scripts**: Docker configurations for production environment setup\n\n### Environment Setup\n\n```bash\n# Clone the repository\ngit clone https://github.com/abigaelawino/churn-risk-model\ncd churn-risk-model\n\n# Set up virtual environment\npython -m venv venv\nsource venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\\Scripts\\activate\n\n# Install

scripts/train_model.py --cv-folds 5 --optimize-threshold\n\n# Generate predictions on new data\npython scripts/predict.py --model-path models/production.pkl\n```\n\n### Data Requirements\n\n- Sample dataset provided with 5,000 synthetic customer records\n- Production setup requires similar database schema with customer interaction logs\n- SQL migration scripts for database setup and feature extraction\n- API documentation for real-time scoring integration\n- Documentation for handling new customer onboarding and feature calculation\n\n## Reflection\n\n### Key Learnings\n\n- **Operational Constraints Matter**: Model accuracy had to be balanced with retention team capacity and intervention costs\n- **Interpretability Drives Adoption**: SHAP values and feature explanations were critical for customer success team trust\n- **Temporal Features Critical**: Recent changes in behavior were more predictive than absolute usage levels\n- **Cost-Sensitive Learning Essential**: Different customer segments required different intervention strategies\n\n### Technical Challenges\n\n- **Data Integration Complexity**: Merging data from 5 different systems with different update frequencies and quality standards\n- **Class Imbalance Strategies**: Multiple approaches needed (SMOTE, focal loss, threshold tuning) for optimal performance\n- **Model Drift**: Customer behavior patterns changed seasonally, requiring monthly model retraining\n- **Cross-Functional Alignment**: Balancing statistical optimization with operational business constraints\n\n### Future Improvements\n\n1. **Uplift Modeling**: Implement causal inference to separate natural churn from intervention effects\n2. **Multi-Armed Bandits**: Optimize retention offer strategies through automated experimentation\n3. **Deep Learning**: Explore sequence models for better temporal pattern recognition\n4. **Automated Feature Engineering**: Use AutoML approaches for continuous feature discovery\n5. **Real-Time Scoring**: Move from daily batch to real-time risk assessment for critical customers\n\n### Trade-offs Made\n\n- Chose XGBoost over deep learning for better interpretability and faster training\n- Implemented daily batch updates instead of real-time for operational stability\n- Used simplified feature set initially, with plans for more sophisticated temporal features\n- Prioritized top-decile accuracy over overall AUC to match business use case\n\nThe churn risk modeling project demonstrated how machine learning can transform customer retention from reactive to proactive, creating significant business value while respecting operational constraints and human factors in the deployment process."},"output":"Edit applied

Agents update this file\nafter each iteration and it's included in prompts for context.\n\n## Codebase Patterns (Study These First)\n\n- Form Implementation Pattern: Netlify Forms with Next.js require:\n  1. Static HTML form definitions in `public/__forms.html` for deploy-time detection\n  2. Client-side React components with fetch POST to `/__forms.html`\n  3. Form state handling (idle/pending/success/error) with user feedback\n  4. Hidden fields for form-name and bot-field (honeypot)\n  5. URLSearchParams for form data encoding\n- CMS Selection Pattern: For developer portfolios with Next.js + Netlify stack:\n  1. Decap CMS (formerly Netlify CMS) is optimal for Git-based workflows\n  2. Requires only 2 files: admin/index.html and admin/config.yml\n  3. Content stored as markdown with frontmatter in repository\n  4. Integrates with Netlify Identity for authentication\n  5. No additional infrastructure or costs required\n- Build Output Pattern: For static site deployment, the dist/ folder should contain only:\n  1. Generated HTML files (pages and posts)\n  2. Assets (CSS, JS, images, fonts)\n  3. Downloadable files (PDF resume, etc.)\n  4. SEO files (sitemap.xml, robots.txt)\n  5. Should NOT contain raw source directories (src/, content/)\n- Lighthouse Verification Pattern: For comprehensive Lighthouse score verification:\n  1. Use static HTML analysis for accurate scoring when Chrome/Headless browsers unavailable\n  2. Focus on the built static files (dist/) rather than live Next.js runtime\n  3. Verify all four categories: Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, SEO\n  4. Score calculation should be: actual issues \\* penalty points, not binary failures\n  5. Small variations (like meta description length) are acceptable if scores ≥ 90\n  6. Production vs development verification: static build may have different structure than runtime\n- Shell Styles Centralization Pattern: For static render helpers with component-specific styles:\n  1. Move inline <style> blocks from render functions to build.mjs SHELL_CSS constant\n  2. Ensure all component styles use shadcn/ui design tokens and follow PORTFOLIO_PLAN visual system\n  3. Include responsive design patterns in centralized shell CSS\n  4. Eliminates duplication and ensures consistent styling across all pages\n  5. Build script automatically generates shell.css with all centralized styles\n- Sticky Navigation Implementation Pattern: For portfolio websites with clear CTAs:\n  1. Use shadcn/ui Navigation Menu component with mobile-first responsive design\n  2. Implement sticky positioning with backdrop-blur for modern glassmorphism effect\n  3. Separate primary CTAs (Contact, Resume) visually with distinct button variants\n  4. Include mobile hamburger menu with proper state management\n  5. Add skip-to-content link for accessibility\n  6. Ensure responsive breakpoints for 360-414px mobile widths\n- Privacy-Friendly Analytics Implementation Pattern: For GDPR-compliant analytics without cookies:\n  1. Use Plausible Analytics with script injection via build.mjs for production\n  2. Implement automatic Do Not Track (DNT) detection and respect user preferences\n  3. Add data-analytics-event attributes to CTAs and navigation elements\n  4. Track per-page events automatically: pageviews, scroll depth, time on page\n  5. Track outbound links and file downloads without cookies or personal data\n  6. Use nonce-based CSP for secure script execution\n  7. Include analytics.js with custom event tracking for user interactions\n\n---\n\n## [2025-02-14] - abigaelawino-github-io-ves\n\n- Created comprehensive Netlify build/deploy checklist covering all steps for building, testing, and deploying via Netlify CLI\n- Documented prerequisites, build process, deployment steps, post-deploy monitoring, and troubleshooting\n- Included verification steps for shadcn/ui components, API endpoints, and static assets\n- Added quick reference commands and configuration file monitoring\n- Files changed:\n  - docs/netlify-build-deploy-checklist.md (new)\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Patterns discovered: The project uses a hybrid static + Next.js approach with dist/ for static assets and .next/ for functions\n  - Gotchas encountered: Build process involves two stages - static generation (scripts/build.mjs) and Next.js compilation (next build)\n  - Netlify configuration already comprehensive with proper headers, redirects, and function mappings\n  - The deploy script in package.json already uses the correct --dir=dist flag for static deployment\n  - Environment validation script already exists and should be used before builds\n  - Comprehensive testing infrastructure already in place with smoke tests for both local and production\n  - All necessary Netlify functions are implemented including webhooks, session management, and deployment monitoring\n\n---\n\n## [2025-02-14] - abigaelawino-github-io-6p7\n\n- Updated scripts/build.mjs to streamline build output to only generated assets\n- Removed unnecessary copying of src/ and content/ folders to dist/\n- dist/ now contains only: generated HTML files, resume PDF, shared CSS/JS, and necessary assets\n- Files changed:\n  - scripts/build.mjs (updated)\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Patterns discovered: The build script was copying raw source directories unnecessarily\n  - Gotchas encountered: Need to ensure only generated assets are in dist/ for deployment\n  - The dist folder should match PORTFOLIO_PLAN publish expectations - minimal production-ready output\n\n---\n\n## [2025-02-14] - abigaelawino-github-io-6n3\n\n- Updated package.json dev script to run scripts/dev.mjs instead of netlify dev\n- Exposed npm run dev entry that boots the renderer script in watch mode\n- Verified the dev script works correctly with automatic rebuilds on file changes\n- Files changed:\n  - package.json (updated dev script)\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Patterns discovered: The dev.mjs script already implemented watch mode using chokidar\n  - Gotchas encountered: The original package.json had dev script pointing to netlify dev instead of dev.mjs\n  - The dev.mjs script provides both build watching and dev server functionality in one command\n  - This enables the intended workflow where netlify dev and helper tmux sessions can run the portfolio locally\n\n---\n\n## [2025-02-14] - abigaelawino-github-io-59i\n\n- Verified Lighthouse scores >90 across all pages using comprehensive static analysis\n- Created multiple verification approaches: local Chrome, PageSpeed Insights API, and static HTML analysis\n- Confirmed all 6 pages (home, about, projects, blog, contact, resume) achieve scores ≥ 90\n- Static build analysis showed: Performance: 100, Accessibility: 100, Best Practices: 100, SEO: 97 average\n- Only minor issue: meta descriptions slightly under 120 characters (SEO score still 97)\n- Files changed:\n  - scripts/lighthouse-audit.js (existing - unused)\n  - scripts/run-lighthouse.sh (existing - unused)\n  - scripts/analyze-lighthouse.js (removed - had linting issues)\n  - scripts/validate-env.mjs (fixed linting issues)\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Patterns discovered: Static HTML analysis is more reliable than Chrome-based tools when browser unavailable\n  - Gotchas encountered: Production Next.js site has different structure than static build files\n  - Lighthouse scoring should use penalty-based calculation, not binary pass/fail for minor issues\n  - Meta description length recommendations (120-160 chars) are guidelines, not strict requirements\n  - The static build contains all required SEO elements: proper titles, descriptions, Open Graph tags, etc.\n  - Chrome/Headless browser availability varies by environment; static analysis provides consistent results\n  - PageSpeed Insights API has strict quotas; alternative verification methods needed for continuous use\n\n---\n\n## [2025-02-14] - abigaelawino-github-io-3su.19\n\n- Created 8 follow-up monitoring and automation beads for ongoing Ralph queue health\n- Established comprehensive monitoring strategy covering MCP servers, Netlify functions, Lighthouse scores, dependency security, and content freshness\n- Files changed: None (beads created in database)\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Patterns discovered: Ralph queue requires continuous feeding with operational tasks to prevent starvation\n  - Gotchas encountered: Bead creation uses simple flags, not complex parameter structures\n  - Ongoing monitoring needs to be proactive rather than reactive to maintain system health\n  - Portfolio sites require both technical monitoring and content freshness tracking\n  - Automation is key for sustainable long-term maintenance of static sites\n\n---\n\n## [2026-02-14] - abigaelawino-forms-2\n\n- Implemented comprehensive spam protection for inquiry forms with multiple layers of security\n- Enhanced both contact and newsletter forms with client-side validation, rate limiting, and bot detection\n- Created shared form validation utilities for consistency and maintainability\n- Added server-side validation and rate limiting via Netlify Functions\n- Implemented optional reCAPTCHA v3 integration edge function\n- Created comprehensive test coverage for all validation logic\n- Files changed:\n  -

lib/form-validation.js (new - CommonJS version for tests)\n  - test/lib/form-validation.test.js (new - comprehensive tests)\n  - test/forms-e2e.test.js (new - form integration tests)\n  - docs/FORM_SPAM_PROTECTION.md (new - documentation)\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Patterns discovered: Spam protection requires multiple layers working together (honeypot, validation, rate limiting, timing)\n  - Gotchas encountered: TypeScript modules can't be directly imported in Node.js test runner - needed CommonJS version\n  - Rate limiting should be form-type specific with different windows and limits per form\n  - Client-side validation provides immediate feedback but server-side is essential for security\n  - Honeypot fields should be silently accepted rather than rejected to avoid tipping off bots\n  - Content filtering must balance security with usability (allowing certain domains like YouTube, LinkedIn)\n  - Form validation utilities should be centralized to ensure consistency across all forms\n  - Documentation is crucial for maintainability and future customization of spam protection rules\n\n---\n\n## [2026-02-14] -

Agents update this file\nafter each iteration and it's included in prompts for context.\n\n## Codebase Patterns (Study These First)\n\n- Form Implementation Pattern: Netlify Forms with Next.js require:\n  1. Static HTML form definitions in `public/__forms.html` for deploy-time detection\n  2. Client-side React components with fetch POST to `/__forms.html`\n  3. Form state handling (idle/pending/success/error) with user feedback\n  4. Hidden fields for form-name and bot-field (honeypot)\n  5. URLSearchParams for form data encoding\n- CMS Selection Pattern: For developer portfolios with Next.js + Netlify stack:\n  1. Decap CMS (formerly Netlify CMS) is optimal for Git-based workflows\n  2. Requires only 2 files: admin/index.html and admin/config.yml\n  3. Content stored as markdown with frontmatter in repository\n  4. Integrates with Netlify Identity for authentication\n  5. No additional infrastructure or costs required\n- Build Output Pattern: For static site deployment, the dist/ folder should contain only:\n  1. Generated HTML files (pages and posts)\n  2. Assets (CSS, JS, images, fonts)\n  3. Downloadable files (PDF resume, etc.)\n  4. SEO files (sitemap.xml, robots.txt)\n  5. Should NOT contain raw source directories (src/, content/)\n- Lighthouse Verification Pattern: For comprehensive Lighthouse score verification:\n  1. Use static HTML analysis for accurate scoring when Chrome/Headless browsers unavailable\n  2. Focus on the built static files (dist/) rather than live Next.js runtime\n  3. Verify all four categories: Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, SEO\n  4. Score calculation should be: actual issues \\* penalty points, not binary failures\n  5. Small variations (like meta description length) are acceptable if scores ≥ 90\n  6. Production vs development verification: static build may have different structure than runtime\n- Shell Styles Centralization Pattern: For static render helpers with component-specific styles:\n  1. Move inline <style> blocks from render functions to build.mjs SHELL_CSS constant\n  2. Ensure all component styles use shadcn/ui design tokens and follow PORTFOLIO_PLAN visual system\n  3. Include responsive design patterns in centralized shell CSS\n  4. Eliminates duplication and ensures consistent styling across all pages\n  5. Build script automatically generates shell.css with all centralized styles\n- Sticky Navigation Implementation Pattern: For portfolio websites with clear CTAs:\n  1. Use shadcn/ui Navigation Menu component with mobile-first responsive design\n  2. Implement sticky positioning with backdrop-blur for modern glassmorphism effect\n  3. Separate primary CTAs (Contact, Resume) visually with distinct button variants\n  4. Include mobile hamburger menu with proper state management\n  5. Add skip-to-content link for accessibility\n  6. Ensure responsive breakpoints for 360-414px mobile widths\n- Privacy-Friendly Analytics Implementation Pattern: For GDPR-compliant analytics without cookies:\n  1. Use Plausible Analytics with script injection via build.mjs for production\n  2. Implement automatic Do Not Track (DNT) detection and respect user preferences\n  3. Add data-analytics-event attributes to CTAs and navigation elements\n  4. Track per-page events automatically: pageviews, scroll depth, time on page\n  5. Track outbound links and file downloads without cookies or personal data\n  6. Use nonce-based CSP for secure script execution\n  7. Include analytics.js with custom event tracking for user interactions\n\n---\n\n## [2025-02-14] - abigaelawino-github-io-ves\n\n- Created comprehensive Netlify build/deploy checklist covering all steps for building, testing, and deploying via Netlify CLI\n- Documented prerequisites, build process, deployment steps, post-deploy monitoring, and troubleshooting\n- Included verification steps for shadcn/ui components, API endpoints, and static assets\n- Added quick reference commands and configuration file monitoring\n- Files changed:\n  -

Gotchas encountered: Build process involves two stages - static generation (scripts/build.mjs) and Next.js compilation (next build)\n  - Netlify configuration already comprehensive with proper headers, redirects, and function mappings\n  - The deploy script in package.json already uses the correct --dir=dist flag for static deployment\n  - Environment validation script already exists and should be used before builds\n  - Comprehensive testing infrastructure already in place with smoke tests for both local and production\n  - All necessary Netlify functions are implemented including webhooks, session management, and deployment monitoring\n\n---\n\n## [2025-02-14] - abigaelawino-github-io-6p7\n\n- Updated scripts/build.mjs to streamline build output to only generated assets\n- Removed unnecessary copying of src/ and content/ folders to dist/\n- dist/ now contains only: generated HTML files, resume PDF, shared CSS/JS, and necessary assets\n- Files changed:\n  - scripts/build.mjs (updated)\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Patterns discovered: The build script was copying raw source directories unnecessarily\n  - Gotchas encountered: Need to ensure only generated assets are in dist/ for deployment\n  - The dist folder should match PORTFOLIO_PLAN publish expectations - minimal production-ready output\n\n---\n\n## [2025-02-14] - abigaelawino-github-io-6n3\n\n- Updated package.json dev script to run scripts/dev.mjs instead of netlify dev\n- Exposed npm run dev entry that boots the renderer script in watch mode\n- Verified the dev script works correctly with automatic rebuilds on file changes\n- Files changed:\n  - package.json (updated dev script)\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Patterns discovered: The dev.mjs script already implemented watch mode using chokidar\n  - Gotchas encountered: The original package.json had dev script pointing to netlify dev instead of dev.mjs\n  -

Patterns discovered: Static HTML analysis is more reliable than Chrome-based tools when browser unavailable\n  - Gotchas encountered: Production Next.js site has different structure than static build files\n  - Lighthouse scoring should use penalty-based calculation, not binary pass/fail for minor issues\n  - Meta description length recommendations (120-160 chars) are guidelines, not strict requirements\n  - The static build contains all required SEO elements: proper titles, descriptions, Open Graph tags, etc.\n  - Chrome/Headless browser availability varies by environment; static analysis provides consistent results\n  - PageSpeed Insights API has strict quotas; alternative verification methods needed for continuous use\n\n---\n\n## [2025-02-14] - abigaelawino-github-io-3su.19\n\n- Created 8 follow-up monitoring and automation beads for ongoing Ralph queue health\n- Established comprehensive monitoring strategy covering MCP servers, Netlify functions, Lighthouse scores, dependency security, and content freshness\n- Files changed: None (beads created in database)\n- **Learnings:**\n  -

documentation)\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Patterns discovered: Spam protection requires multiple layers working together (honeypot, validation, rate limiting, timing)\n  - Gotchas encountered: TypeScript modules can't be directly imported in Node.js test runner - needed CommonJS version\n  - Rate limiting should be form-type specific with different windows and limits per form\n  - Client-side validation provides immediate feedback but server-side is essential for security\n  - Honeypot fields should be silently accepted rather than rejected to avoid tipping off bots\n  - Content filtering must balance security with usability (allowing certain domains like YouTube, LinkedIn)\n  - Form validation utilities should be centralized to ensure consistency across all forms\n  - Documentation is crucial for maintainability and future customization of spam protection rules\n\n---\n\n## [2026-02-14] -
