Agents update this file\n4: after each iteration and it's included in prompts for context.\n5: \n6: ## Codebase Patterns (Study These First)\n7: \n8: - Form Implementation Pattern: Netlify Forms with Next.js require:\n9:   1. Static HTML form definitions in `public/__forms.html` for deploy-time detection\n10:   2. Client-side React components with fetch POST to `/__forms.html`\n11:   3. Form state handling (idle/pending/success/error) with user feedback\n12:   4. Hidden fields for form-name and bot-field (honeypot)\n13:   5. URLSearchParams for form data encoding\n14: - CMS Selection Pattern: For developer portfolios with Next.js + Netlify stack:\n15:   1. Decap CMS (formerly Netlify CMS) is optimal for Git-based workflows\n16:   2. Requires only 2 files: admin/index.html and admin/config.yml\n17:   3. Content stored as markdown with frontmatter in repository\n18:   4. Integrates with Netlify Identity for authentication\n19:   5. No additional infrastructure or costs required\n20: - Build Output Pattern: For static site deployment, the dist/ folder should contain only:\n21:   1. Generated HTML files (pages and posts)\n22:   2. Assets (CSS, JS, images, fonts)\n23:   3. Downloadable files (PDF resume, etc.)\n24:   4. SEO files (sitemap.xml, robots.txt)\n25:   5. Should NOT contain raw source directories (src/, content/)\n26: - Lighthouse Verification Pattern: For comprehensive Lighthouse score verification:\n27:   1. Use static HTML analysis for accurate scoring when Chrome/Headless browsers unavailable\n28:   2. Focus on the built static files (dist/) rather than live Next.js runtime\n29:   3. Verify all four categories: Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, SEO\n30:   4. Score calculation should be: actual issues * penalty points, not binary failures\n31:   5. Small variations (like meta description length) are acceptable if scores ≥ 90\n32:   6. Production vs development verification: static build may have different structure than runtime\n33: \n34: ---\n35: \n36: ## [Date] - abigaelawino-forms-1\n37: - Implemented Netlify Forms with Next.js workaround following OpenNext documentation\n38: - Created ContactForm and NewsletterForm components with proper state management\n39: - Updated contact page to use the new ContactForm component\n40: - Files changed: \n41:   - components/contact-form.tsx (new)\n42:   - components/newsletter-form.tsx (new)  \n43:   - app/contact/page.tsx (updated)\n44: - **Learnings:**\n45:   - Patterns discovered: Netlify Forms require static HTML detection file at `public/__forms.html`\n46:   - Gotchas encountered: Must POST to the static HTML file path, not to API routes\n47:   - Form submission requires `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` content type with URLSearchParams\n48:    - Important to include hidden fields for form-name and bot-field (honeypot)\n49:    - State management with TypeScript interfaces provides better type safety\n50: ---\n51: \n52: ## [2025-02-14] - abigaelawino-github-io-6p7\n53: - Updated scripts/build.mjs to streamline build output to only generated assets\n54: - Removed unnecessary copying of src/ and content/ folders to dist/\n55: - dist/ now contains only: generated HTML files, resume PDF, shared CSS/JS, and necessary assets\n56: - Files changed:\n57:   - scripts/build.mjs (updated)\n58: - **Learnings:**\n59:   - Patterns discovered: The build script was copying raw source directories unnecessarily\n60:   - Gotchas encountered: Need to ensure only generated assets are in dist/ for deployment\n61:   - The dist folder should match PORTFOLIO_PLAN publish expectations - minimal production-ready output\n62: ---\n63: \n64: ## [2025-02-14] - abigaelawino-github-io-6n3\n65: - Updated package.json dev script to run scripts/dev.mjs instead of netlify dev\n66: - Exposed npm run dev entry that boots the renderer script in watch mode\n67: - Verified the dev script works correctly with automatic rebuilds on file changes\n68: - Files changed:\n69:   - package.json (updated dev script)\n70: - **Learnings:**\n71:   - Patterns discovered: The dev.mjs script already implemented watch mode using chokidar\n72:   - Gotchas encountered: The original package.json had dev script pointing to netlify dev instead of dev.mjs\n73:   - The dev.mjs script provides both build watching and dev server functionality in one command\n74:   - This enables the intended workflow where netlify dev and helper tmux sessions can run the portfolio locally\n75: \n76: ---\n77: \n78: ## [2025-02-14] - abigaelawino-github-io-59i\n79: - Verified Lighthouse scores >90 across all pages using comprehensive static analysis\n80: - Created multiple verification approaches: local Chrome, PageSpeed Insights API, and static HTML analysis\n81: - Confirmed all 6 pages (home, about, projects, blog, contact, resume) achieve scores ≥ 90\n82: - Static build analysis showed: Performance: 100, Accessibility: 100, Best Practices: 100, SEO: 97 average\n83: - Only minor issue: meta descriptions slightly under 120 characters (SEO score still 97)\n84: - Files changed:\n85:   - scripts/lighthouse-audit.js (existing - unused)\n86:   - scripts/run-lighthouse.sh (existing - unused) \n87:   - scripts/analyze-lighthouse.js (removed - had linting issues)\n88:   - scripts/validate-env.mjs (fixed linting issues)\n89: - **Learnings:**\n90:   - Patterns discovered: Static HTML analysis is more reliable than Chrome-based tools when browser unavailable\n91:   - Gotchas encountered: Production Next.js site has different structure than static build files\n92:   - Lighthouse scoring should use penalty-based calculation, not binary pass/fail for minor issues\n93:   - Meta description length recommendations (120-160 chars) are guidelines, not strict requirements\n94:   - The static build contains all required SEO elements: proper titles, descriptions, Open Graph tags, etc.\n95:   - Chrome/Headless browser availability varies by environment; static analysis provides consistent results\n96:   - PageSpeed Insights API has strict quotas; alternative verification methods needed for continuous use\n97: \n98: ---\n99: \n100: ## [2025-02-14] - abigaelawino-github-io-3su.19\n101: - Created 8 follow-up monitoring and automation beads for ongoing Ralph queue health\n102: - Established comprehensive monitoring strategy covering MCP servers, Netlify functions, Lighthouse scores, dependency security, and content freshness\n103: - Files changed: None (beads created in database)\n104: - **Learnings:**\n105:   - Patterns discovered: Ralph queue requires continuous feeding with operational tasks to prevent starvation\n106:   - Gotchas encountered: Bead creation uses simple flags, not complex parameter structures\n107:   - Ongoing monitoring needs to be proactive rather than reactive to maintain system health\n108:   - Portfolio sites require both technical monitoring and content freshness tracking\n109:   - Automation is key for sustainable long-term maintenance of static sites\n110: \n111: ---\n112: \n113: ## [2025-02-14] - abigaelawino-cms-1\n114: - Researched and evaluated 5 headless CMS options for portfolio content management\n115: - Created comprehensive CMS research document with detailed analysis and recommendations\n116: - Files changed:\n117:   - docs/cms-research.md (new)\n118: - **Learnings:**\n119:   - Patterns discovered: Decap CMS is optimal for Next.js + Netlify portfolio stack\n120:   - Gotchas encountered: Netlify CMS was rebranded to Decap CMS in 2023\n121:   - Decap CMS requires only 2 files for setup: admin/index.html and admin/config.yml\n122:   - Content stored as markdown files with frontmatter provides version control through Git\n123:   - Free tier limitations vary significantly between CMS options\n124:   - Real-time collaboration features come at significant cost premium\n125:   - Git-based CMS eliminates need for separate database and infrastructure\n126:   - Developer portfolio use case prioritizes simplicity and zero cost over advanced features\n127: ---\n128: \n129: ## [2025-02-14] - abigaelawino-github-io-3su\n130: - Enhanced portfolio website with comprehensive shadcn/ui component integration\n131: - Updated homepage to use Card, Button, and Badge components for modern, professional design\n132: - Enhanced project pages with shadcn/ui Card components for consistent visual hierarchy\n133: - Updated navigation to use shadcn/ui Button components with improved accessibility\n134: - Implemented responsive design with Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui design tokens\n135: - Created Badge component for project tags and tech stacks with consistent styling\n136: - Enhanced project detail pages with structured Card-based layout\n137: - Files changed:\n138:   - app/page.tsx (updated with shadcn/ui components)\n139:   - app/projects/page.tsx (updated with Card components)\n140:   - app/about/page.tsx (updated with comprehensive shadcn/ui layout)\n141:   - app/contact/page.tsx (updated with Card and Button components)\n142:   - app/layout.tsx (updated navigation with shadcn/ui components)\n143:   - app/projects/[slug]/page.tsx (updated with Card-based layout)\n144:   - components/ui/badge.tsx (new)\n145:   - app/globals.css (updated for responsive design and shadcn/ui styling)\n146:   - lib/content.ts (enhanced error handling)\n147: - **Learnings:**\n148:   - Patterns discovered: shadcn/ui components provide excellent consistency and accessibility out of the box\n149:   - Gotchas encountered: Build warnings about undefined slugs required better error handling in content loading\n150:   - Responsive design with shadcn/ui requires careful attention to container utilities and spacing\n151:   - Component composition with shadcn/ui follows intuitive patterns (Card -> CardHeader -> CardTitle)\n152:   - Badge components work perfectly for categorizing projects and skills with visual hierarchy\n153:   - Button variants (ghost, outline, default) provide excellent UX differentiation\n154:   - Card hover effects and transitions enhance user engagement significantly\n155:   - shadcn/ui design tokens (CSS variables) ensure consistent theming across components\n156: \n157: ---\n158: \n\n(End of file - total 158 lines)\n</content>","title":".ralph-tui/progress.md","metadata":{"preview":"# Ralph Progress Log\n\nThis file tracks progress across iterations.

components\n\n---\n\n## [2025-02-14] - abigaelawino-github-io-6ji\n- Expanded shadcn/ui build coverage across all static render helpers\n- Updated build.mjs to include comprehensive Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui design system for production builds\n- Replaced custom component styles with shadcn/ui equivalents in home.js, projects.js, about.js, contact.js, blog.js, and resume.js\n- Ensured all pages use consistent Card, Button, Badge, and layout components with proper responsive design\n- Verified build output shows properly rendered shadcn/ui components in static HTML\n- Files changed:\n  - scripts/build.mjs (updated with comprehensive shadcn/ui CSS)\n  - src/home.js (updated with Card, Button components)\n  - src/projects.js (updated with Card, Badge, Button components)\n  - src/about.js (updated with Card, Badge components)\n  - src/contact.js (updated with Card, Button components)\n  - src/blog.js (updated with Card, Badge components)\n  - src/resume.js (updated with Card, Button components)\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Patterns discovered: Static render helpers need explicit CSS injection since they don't use React components\n  - Gotchas encountered: shadcn/ui design tokens (CSS variables) must be included in build CSS for proper rendering\n  - Component classes map directly to shadcn/ui patterns: card, button, badge with variant classes\n  - Responsive utilities need explicit inclusion since Tailwind isn't processed in static builds\n  - Icon usage requires inline SVG for compatibility with static HTML generation\n  - The build output maintains component structure even in static form, ensuring visual consistency\n  - Accessibility features like ARIA labels and semantic HTML are preserved in static generation\n\n---"},"output":"Edit applied

Agents update this file\nafter each iteration and it's included in prompts for context.\n\n## Codebase Patterns (Study These First)\n\n- Form Implementation Pattern: Netlify Forms with Next.js require:\n  1. Static HTML form definitions in `public/__forms.html` for deploy-time detection\n  2. Client-side React components with fetch POST to `/__forms.html`\n  3. Form state handling (idle/pending/success/error) with user feedback\n  4. Hidden fields for form-name and bot-field (honeypot)\n  5. URLSearchParams for form data encoding\n- CMS Selection Pattern: For developer portfolios with Next.js + Netlify stack:\n  1. Decap CMS (formerly Netlify CMS) is optimal for Git-based workflows\n  2. Requires only 2 files: admin/index.html and admin/config.yml\n  3. Content stored as markdown with frontmatter in repository\n  4. Integrates with Netlify Identity for authentication\n  5. No additional infrastructure or costs required\n- Build Output Pattern: For static site deployment, the dist/ folder should contain only:\n  1. Generated HTML files (pages and posts)\n  2. Assets (CSS, JS, images, fonts)\n  3. Downloadable files (PDF resume, etc.)\n  4. SEO files (sitemap.xml, robots.txt)\n  5. Should NOT contain raw source directories (src/, content/)\n- Lighthouse Verification Pattern: For comprehensive Lighthouse score verification:\n  1. Use static HTML analysis for accurate scoring when Chrome/Headless browsers unavailable\n  2. Focus on the built static files (dist/) rather than live Next.js runtime\n  3. Verify all four categories: Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, SEO\n  4. Score calculation should be: actual issues * penalty points, not binary failures\n  5. Small variations (like meta description length) are acceptable if scores ≥ 90\n  6. Production vs development verification: static build may have different structure than runtime\n\n---\n\n## [Date] - abigaelawino-forms-1\n- Implemented Netlify Forms with Next.js workaround following OpenNext documentation\n- Created ContactForm and NewsletterForm components with proper state management\n- Updated contact page to use the new ContactForm component\n- Files changed: \n  - components/contact-form.tsx (new)\n  - components/newsletter-form.tsx (new)  \n  - app/contact/page.tsx (updated)\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Patterns discovered: Netlify Forms require static HTML detection file at `public/__forms.html`\n  - Gotchas encountered: Must POST to the static HTML file path, not to API routes\n  - Form submission requires `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` content type with URLSearchParams\n   - Important to include hidden fields for form-name and bot-field (honeypot)\n   - State management with TypeScript interfaces provides better type safety\n---\n\n## [2025-02-14] - abigaelawino-github-io-6p7\n- Updated scripts/build.mjs to streamline build output to only generated assets\n- Removed unnecessary copying of src/ and content/ folders to dist/\n- dist/ now contains only: generated HTML files, resume PDF, shared CSS/JS, and necessary assets\n- Files changed:\n  - scripts/build.mjs (updated)\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Patterns discovered: The build script was copying raw source directories unnecessarily\n  - Gotchas encountered: Need to ensure only generated assets are in dist/ for deployment\n  - The dist folder should match PORTFOLIO_PLAN publish expectations - minimal production-ready output\n---\n\n## [2025-02-14] - abigaelawino-github-io-6n3\n- Updated package.json dev script to run scripts/dev.mjs instead of netlify dev\n- Exposed npm run dev entry that boots the renderer script in watch mode\n- Verified the dev script works correctly with automatic rebuilds on file changes\n- Files changed:\n  - package.json (updated dev script)\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Patterns discovered: The dev.mjs script already implemented watch mode using chokidar\n  - Gotchas encountered: The original package.json had dev script pointing to netlify dev instead of dev.mjs\n  - The dev.mjs script provides both build watching and dev server functionality in one command\n  - This enables the intended workflow where netlify dev and helper tmux sessions can run the portfolio locally\n\n---\n\n## [2025-02-14] - abigaelawino-github-io-59i\n- Verified Lighthouse scores >90 across all pages using comprehensive static analysis\n- Created multiple verification approaches: local Chrome, PageSpeed Insights API, and static HTML analysis\n- Confirmed all 6 pages (home, about, projects, blog, contact, resume) achieve scores ≥ 90\n- Static build analysis showed: Performance: 100, Accessibility: 100, Best Practices: 100, SEO: 97 average\n- Only minor issue: meta descriptions slightly under 120 characters (SEO score still 97)\n- Files changed:\n  - scripts/lighthouse-audit.js (existing - unused)\n  - scripts/run-lighthouse.sh (existing - unused) \n  - scripts/analyze-lighthouse.js (removed - had linting issues)\n  - scripts/validate-env.mjs (fixed linting issues)\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Patterns discovered: Static HTML analysis is more reliable than Chrome-based tools when browser unavailable\n  - Gotchas encountered: Production Next.js site has different structure than static build files\n  - Lighthouse scoring should use penalty-based calculation, not binary pass/fail for minor issues\n  - Meta description length recommendations (120-160 chars) are guidelines, not strict requirements\n  - The static build contains all required SEO elements: proper titles, descriptions, Open Graph tags, etc.\n  - Chrome/Headless browser availability varies by environment;

I have successfully expanded the shadcn/ui build coverage for the portfolio site. Here's a summary of what was accomplished:\n\n## Summary\n\nI updated all the static render helpers to use shadcn/ui components, ensuring the production build has the same visual consistency as the development version:\n\n### Key Changes Made:\n\n1. **Updated build.mjs** with comprehensive Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui design system\n2. **Updated all render helpers** (home.js, projects.js, about.js, contact.js, blog.js, resume.js) to use shadcn/ui components\n3. **Replaced custom styling** with proper shadcn/ui Card, Button, Badge components\n4. **Ensured responsive design** works correctly in static builds\n5. **Verified the build output** shows properly rendered shadcn/ui components\n\n### Technical Learnings:\n\n- Static render helpers need explicit CSS injection since they don't use React components\n- shadcn/ui design tokens (CSS variables) must be included in build CSS for proper rendering\n- Component classes map directly to shadcn/ui patterns: card, button, badge with variant classes\n- Responsive utilities need explicit inclusion since Tailwind isn't processed in static builds\n- Icon usage requires inline SVG for compatibility with static HTML generation\n\nThe build now generates static HTML with proper shadcn/ui styling that matches the Next.js development experience, ensuring visual consistency across development and production environments.\n<promise>COMPLETE</promise>","time":{"start":1771096314459,"end":1771096314459}}}
