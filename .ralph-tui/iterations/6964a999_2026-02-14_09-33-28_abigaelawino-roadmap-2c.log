Agents update this file\n4: after each iteration and it's included in prompts for context.\n5: \n6: ## Codebase Patterns (Study These First)\n7: \n8: ### DOM Testing Pattern\n9: When testing client-side JavaScript functionality that requires a DOM environment:\n10: 1. Use JSDOM to create a mock browser environment\n11: 2. Mock missing browser APIs (canvas, crypto, alert, etc.)\n12: 3. Load and execute client-side scripts in the mock environment\n13: 4. Test DOM interactions and event handling\n14: 5. Clean up global variables after each test\n15: \n16: ### Security-First Form Pattern\n17: Contact forms should include multiple layers of protection:\n18: 1. Netlify's built-in honeypot protection (netlify-honeypot attribute)\n19: 2. Custom honeypot fields (hidden inputs that bots might fill)\n20: 3. Client-side fingerprinting using canvas and browser characteristics\n21: 4. Timing validation to prevent bot submissions\n22: 5. Proper CSP headers to restrict form actions\n23: 6. Analytics tracking for form interactions\n24: \n25: ### MDX Content Pipeline Pattern\n26: For MDX content management in Next.js with Turbopack:\n27: 1. Use next-mdx-remote with RSC support for dynamic MDX rendering\n28: 2. Create a content library with file system operations for build-time processing\n29: 3. Define TypeScript interfaces for frontmatter schemas\n30: 4. Strip frontmatter from content before MDX rendering\n31: 5. Use client components for interactive content but server components for initial data fetching\n32: 6. Implement proper error handling with notFound() for missing content\n33: 7. Create responsive CSS layouts for content cards and detail pages\n34: \n35: ---\n36: \n37: ## [2026-02-14] - abigaelawino-roadmap-2a\n38: - What was implemented:\n39:   - MDX content pipeline using next-mdx-remote for dynamic MDX rendering\n40:   - Frontmatter parsing with comprehensive field support (title, date, tags, summary, tech, repo, cover, status, readingTime, case study fields)\n41:   - Auto-generated content indexes from frontmatter data\n42:   - Tag filtering support with dedicated tag pages\n43:   - Dynamic routes for blog posts and projects\n44:   - Content library with TypeScript interfaces for type safety\n45:   - CSS styling for blog and project pages with responsive design\n46: \n47: - Files changed:\n48:   - package.json (added next-mdx-remote, reading-time, gray-matter dependencies)\n49:   - lib/content.ts (new comprehensive content management library)\n50:   - app/blog/page.tsx (new blog listing page with post cards)\n51:   - app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx (new dynamic blog post page with MDX rendering)\n52:   - app/projects/page.tsx (new projects listing page)\n53:   - app/projects/[slug]/page.tsx (new dynamic project page with case study details)\n54:   - app/tags/page.tsx (new tags overview page)\n55:   - app/tags/[tag]/page.tsx (new tag filtering page)\n56:   - app/blog/page.css (new blog page styles)\n57:   - app/blog/[slug]/page.css (new blog post styles)\n58:   - app/projects/page.css (new projects page styles)\n59:   - app/projects/[slug]/page.css (new project page styles)\n60:   - app/tags/page.css (new tags page styles)\n61:   - app/tags/[tag]/page.css (new tag page styles)\n62: \n63: - **Learnings:**\n64:   - Next.js with Turbopack has strict module resolution for Node.js built-ins in client components\n65:   - 'use client' directive affects how Node.js modules can be imported and used\n66:   - MDX content needs careful frontmatter stripping to avoid rendering metadata\n67:   - TypeScript interfaces improve developer experience for content schemas\n68:   - CSS modules provide better style isolation than inline styles\n69:   - Tag-based content organization enables flexible content filtering\n70: \n71: ---\n72: \n73: ## [2026-02-14] - abigaelawino-github-io-o69\n74: - What was implemented:\n75:   - Comprehensive security audit of Node/Netlify stack\n76:   - Environment variable validation script for production security\n77:   - API rate limiting function with proper headers and IP masking\n78:   - Enhanced webhook security with environment validation\n79:   - Detailed security audit report with findings and recommendations\n80: \n81: - Files changed:\n82:   - SECURITY_AUDIT.md (new comprehensive security audit report)\n83:   - scripts/validate-env.mjs (new environment validation script)\n84:   - netlify/functions/rate-limiter.js (new rate limiting function)\n85:   - netlify/functions/build-webhook.js (enhanced with env validation)\n86:   - netlify.toml (added rate limit endpoint redirect)\n87:   - package.json (integrated env validation into CI pipeline)\n88: \n89: - **Learnings:**\n90:   - The project already has strong security foundations: comprehensive CSP headers, multi-layer form protection, dependency scanning\n91:   - Netlify's built-in honeypot protection combined with custom security layers provides excellent form spam protection\n92:   - Environment variable validation is crucial for webhook security and production deployments\n93:   - Rate limiting implementation should consider IP privacy (masking) and proper headers for client visibility\n94:   - Security score improved from 7.5/10 to 8.5/10 with implemented improvements\n95:   - The contact form uses advanced fingerprinting with canvas, screen resolution, timezone, and language for bot detection\n96: \n97: ### Security-First Environment Validation Pattern\n98: When deploying Netlify functions that handle sensitive operations:\n99: 1. Validate required environment variables at function startup\n100: 2. Use context-specific validation (production vs development vs webhook)\n101: 3. Provide clear error messages for missing variables\n102: 4. Include security-specific validations (secret length, format)\n103: 5. Integrate validation into CI/CD pipeline to catch issues early\n104: \n105: ### API Rate Limiting Pattern\n106: For Netlify functions that need rate protection:\n107: 1. Implement IP-based rate limiting with reasonable windows (1 minute)\n108: 2. Include proper rate limit headers (X-RateLimit-Limit, X-RateLimit-Remaining, X-RateLimit-Reset)\n109: 3. Mask IP addresses for privacy in logs\n110: 4. Use automatic cleanup for old entries to prevent memory leaks\n111: 5. Return 429 status with Retry-After header when limits exceeded\n112: \n113: ---\n114: - Files changed:\n115:   - No files changed - this was a verification task\n116: \n117: - **Learnings:**\n118:   - The Netlify site (abigael-awino-portfolio) is not yet fully connected to GitHub for automatic builds\n119:   - Build hook created successfully: https://api.netlify.com/build_hooks/69907c7987f5c957891efd4a\n120:   - To complete auto-build setup, a GitHub webhook needs to be configured manually to call this build hook on push events\n121:   - All deployments currently show null for commit_ref and branch, indicating no GitHub integration\n122:   - Manual hook trigger works correctly, but automation requires GitHub webhook setup\n123: \n124: ### Next Steps for Full Auto-Build:\n125: 1. Go to GitHub repository Settings > Webhooks\n126: 2. Add new webhook with URL: https://api.netlify.com/build_hooks/69907c7987f5c957891efd4a\n127: 3. Select \"Just the push event\" trigger\n128: 4. Ensure \"Active\" is checked\n129: 5. Save the webhook to enable automatic builds on push\n130: \n131: ---\n132: \n133: ## [2026-02-14] - abigaelawino-github-io-6rh\n134: - What was implemented:\n135:   - Comprehensive end-to-end tests for the contact form with spam protection\n136:   - 14 new test cases covering form rendering, security features, and edge cases\n137:   - Tests for Netlify form handling, honeypot fields, fingerprinting, and timing validation\n138:   - Tests for form validation, analytics tracking, and thanks page rendering\n139:   - Fixed CSP form-action restriction in netlify.toml\n140: \n141: - Files changed:\n142:   - test/contact-e2e.test.js (new file with comprehensive contact form tests)\n143:   - netlify.toml (fixed CSP form-action syntax)\n144:   - package.json (added jsdom and canvas dev dependencies)\n145: \n146: - **Learnings:**\n147:   - JSDOM requires extensive mocking for missing browser APIs like canvas, crypto, and alert\n148:   - The analytics.js uses an IIFE pattern that requires careful setup in test environments\n149:   - Form security involves multiple layers: Netlify's built-in protection, custom honeypots, fingerprinting, and timing validation\n150:   - Event handling in tests requires proper event object creation with cancelable: true to test prevention\n151:   - Testing client-side code requires understanding of the global scope and how scripts access browser APIs\n152:   - Contact form flow includes validation, security checks, analytics tracking, and proper redirect handling\n153: \n154: ---\n155: \n156: ## [2026-02-14] - abigaelawino-github-io-6xg\n157: - What was implemented:\n158:   - Comprehensive smoke testing script for rendered endpoints\n159:   - Remote smoke testing with HTTP requests to live URLs\n160:   - Local smoke testing for built files without requiring server\n161:   - Quick mode for fast CI/CD feedback and full mode for comprehensive testing\n162:   - Integration into CI pipeline with proper exit codes\n163:   - Documentation and usage guides for different testing scenarios\n164: \n165: - Files changed:\n166:   - scripts/smoke-test.mjs (new - remote endpoint testing with curl/fetch)\n167:   - scripts/smoke-test-local.mjs (new - local file testing without server)\n168:   - package.json (added smoke-test, smoke-test:prod, smoke-test:quick, smoke-test:local scripts)\n169:   - SMOKE_TEST.md (new comprehensive documentation)\n170:   - .ralph-tui/progress.md (updated with implementation details)\n171: \n172: - **Learnings:**\n173:   - The smoke test revealed the actual state of the deployed site (6/7 main pages working)\n174:   - Contact/thanks page is missing from the current deployment (404)\n175:   - API endpoints return 400/404, suggesting functions need deployment or configuration\n176:   - Static assets exist in dist but may not be deployed to production\n177:   - Local testing is more reliable than remote testing for CI/CD pipelines\n178:   - Quick mode provides fast feedback for main pages while full mode tests everything\n179:   - Production site uses Netlify (abigael-awino-portfolio.netlify.app) not GitHub Pages\n180: \n181: ### Smoke Testing Pattern\n182: For testing rendered endpoints after build/deploy cycles:\n183: 1. Use local smoke testing for fast CI feedback on built files\n184: 2. Use remote smoke testing to validate actual deployed endpoints\n185: 3. Implement quick mode for essential pages and full mode for comprehensive testing\n186: 4. Include proper exit codes (0 for success, 1 for failure) for CI/CD integration\n187: 5. Test both main content pages and supporting assets (robots.txt, sitemap.xml)\n188: 6. Validate expected content presence, not just HTTP status codes\n189: \n190: ### CI/CD Integration\n191: - Added smoke-test:quick to the main ci script for automated validation\n192: - Local testing is more reliable than remote testing in CI environments\n193: - Remote testing should be used post-deployment to verify live site functionality\n194: \n195: ---\n196: \n197: ## [2026-02-14] - abigaelawino-roadmap-1a\n198: - What was implemented:\n199:   - Removed static export mode from Next.js configuration\n200:   - Updated Netlify publish directory from \"dist\" to \".next\"\n201:   - Verified NETLIFY_NEXT_SKEW_PROTECTION environment variable is properly configured\n202:   - Confirmed Next.js 16.1.6 doesn't require experimental.useDeploymentId (only needed for < 14.1.4)\n203: \n204: - Files changed:\n205:   - next.config.js (removed output: 'export')\n206:   - netlify.toml (changed publish directory from \"dist\" to \".next\")\n207: \n208: - **Learnings:**\n209:   - The project was previously using static export mode which limits Next.js capabilities on Netlify\n210:   - OpenNext adapter enables server-side features and better performance on Netlify\n211:   - NETLIFY_NEXT_SKEW_PROTECTION was already configured for security\n212:   - Next.js 16.1.6 automatically includes deployment optimizations without needing experimental flags\n213:   - Build successfully generates .next directory with proper server and static assets\n214: \n215: ### Next.js OpenNext Migration Pattern\n216: When migrating from static export to OpenNext on Netlify:\n217: 1. Remove output: 'export' from next.config.js to enable server features\n218: 2. Update netlify.toml publish directory to \".next\" \n219: 3. Ensure NETLIFY_NEXT_SKEW_PROTECTION=true is set in environment variables\n220: 4. For Next.js < 14.1.4, add experimental.useDeploymentId to config\n221: 5. Verify build generates .next directory with server/app structure\n222: 6. Test that static assets and server components work correctly\n223: \n224: ---\n225: \n226: ## [2026-02-14] - abigaelawino-github-io-pi4\n227: - What was implemented:\n228:   - Comprehensive validation of Netlify build configuration and hooks\n229:   - Verified build hook functionality with manual trigger test\n230:   - Confirmed redirects configuration for API endpoints\n231:   - Documented current deployment pipeline status\n232:   - Identified missing GitHub integration and /issues route\n233: \n234: - Files changed:\n235:   - None (validation-only task)\n236: \n237: - **Learnings:**\n238:   - Build hook is active and functional: https://api.netlify.com/build_hooks/69907c7987f5c957891efd4a\n239:   - Manual trigger works correctly (HTTP 200 response)\n240:   - Site has 7 redirects configured for API endpoints (/api/* -> /.netlify/functions/*)\n241:   - No redirect exists for /issues route (returns 404)\n242:   - Deployments show null commit_ref and branch, confirming no GitHub integration\n243:   - Recent build history shows no automated builds (last successful: Feb 12, 2026)\n244:   - Site configuration includes comprehensive security headers and CSP policies\n245:   - All deployments are manual, requiring webhook setup for automation\n246: \n247: ### Netlify Build Pipeline Health Checklist\n248: 1. **Build Hook**: ✅ Created and functional\n249: 2. **GitHub Webhook**: ❌ Not configured (manual setup required)\n250: 3. **Redirects**: ✅ API endpoints properly routed\n251: 4. **Issues Route**: ❌ Missing (/issues returns 404)\n252: 5. **Auto-builds**: ❌ Disabled (no GitHub integration)\n253: 6. **Security Headers**: ✅ Comprehensive CSP and security policies\n254: \n255: ### To Complete Auto-Build Setup:\n256: 1.

minimalist color palette using shadcn/ui design tokens\n25: - Components: Leverage shadcn/ui components (Card, Button, Navigation Menu, etc.) for consistency\n26: - Typography: Use shadcn/ui typography system with custom fonts if needed\n27: - Navigation: shadcn/ui Navigation Menu with sticky top nav and clear CTAs (View Resume, Contact)\n28: - Cards: shadcn/ui Card components for consistent project cards with tags, summaries, and primary CTA (\"Read case study\")\n29: - Mobile-first: ensure shadcn/ui responsive design works at 360–414 px widths\n30: \n31: ## Tech Stack (focused on shadcn/ui)\n32: - Frontend: Next.js + TypeScript; UI components via shadcn/ui (https://ui.shadcn.com/docs)\n33: - Styling: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui component system for consistent design\n34: - Data viz: Recharts or Plotly for interactive charts; embed static matplotlib/Altair PNGs when needed\n35: - Content: Markdown/MDX for blog and case studies; consider a headless CMS (e.g., Contentlayer) later\n36: - Analytics: privacy-friendly (e.g., Plausible or self-hosted) with per-page event tracking\n37: - Deployment: Vercel or Netlify with preview deploys on PRs; set up a custom domain\n38: \n39: ## Performance, Accessibility, SEO\n40: - Performance: image optimization (next/image), prefetch featured links, code-split heavy viz.\n41: - Accessibility: semantic HTML, focus states, alt text on all figures/charts.\n42: - SEO: per-page titles/descriptions, Open Graph images for projects, sitemap and robots.txt.\n43: \n44: ## Content Pipeline\n45: - Projects stored as MDX in `content/projects/`; frontmatter fields: `title`, `date`, `tags`, `summary`, `tech`, `repo`, `cover`, `status`.\n46: - Blog posts in `content/blog/`; similar frontmatter plus `readingTime`.\n47: - Auto-generate project index from frontmatter; support tag filtering.\n48: \n49: ## Data & Visualization Standards\n50: - Always show baselines and confidence where applicable.\n51: - Use consistent color encodings and units across charts.\n52: - Provide downloadable assets for key artifacts (model cards, notebooks, CSV samples).\n53: \n54: ## Integration & Automation\n55: - CI: lint (`eslint`), type-check (`tsc`), format (`prettier --check`), test (`vitest` or `jest`), build.\n56: - Pre-commit: format + lint staged files.\n57: - Deploy previews on PRs; block merges on failing checks.\n58: - shadcn/ui MCP server integration configured for Codex for component management and updates\n59: - Ensure the local dev workflow exposes `npm run dev`/`netlify dev` with live rebuilds and a lightweight server so helper sessions mirror the Next.js starter experience.\n60: - Coverage gate: add `npm run coverage` with 100% statement/line/function/branch thresholds so every PR must meet the bar before Netlify builds.\n61: - Secure Netlify runbooks: keep `netlify.toml` aligned with the Next Platform Starter template, audit webhooks/hooks, and document the CLI steps required for each deploy so helper sessions reproduce the secure flow.\n62: \n63: ## Security & Privacy\n64: - No secrets in the repo; use environment variables.\n65: - If collecting emails, enable spam protection (honeypot/Recaptcha) and note privacy in a short policy.\n66: - Prioritize secure coding practices: review dependencies, add CSP/security headers, and keep Netlify forms/bots under tight control per the plan.\n67: \n68: ## Launch Checklist\n69: - [ ] At least 3 polished case studies following the template.\n70: - [ ] Resume PDF uploaded and linked.\n71: - [ ] Open Graph/Twitter cards configured and validated.\n72: - [ ] Lighthouse scores: >90 for Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, SEO.\n73: - [ ] Contact form tested end-to-end.\n74: - [ ] Code coverage 100% for statements/lines/functions/branches enforced by the coverage scripts.\n75: - [ ] Netlify deploys verify header/CSP policies, require the secure build pipeline, and log every smoke-test URL hit.\n76: \n77: ## Roadmap (example)\n78: - Week 1: Set up Next.js, configure shadcn/ui, layout, navigation, theming, initial CI\n79: - Week 2: Implement content pipeline (MDX), iT SHOULD BE BASED  project cards, case study page template\n80: - Week 3: Add two featured projects using shadcn/ui components, blog index, analytics, SEO passes\n81: - Week 4: Add remaining projects, polish accessibility with shadcn/ui accessibility features, finalize resume/contact, run Lighthouse and ship\n82: \n\n(End of file - total 82 lines)\n</content>","title":"Docs/PORTFOLIO_PLAN.md","metadata":{"preview":"# Data Science Portfolio Website Plan\n\n## Goals & Audience\n- Showcase end-to-end data projects, communicating impact and rigor.\n- Target hiring managers, data leads, and peers;

Performed extensive data cleaning including standardizing customer IDs across systems, handling missing engagement metrics through multiple imputation, and creating temporal features to capture usage trends over time.\ncaseStudyMethods: Trained gradient-boosted trees (XGBoost) with recency-frequency-monetary (RFM) features, including login frequency, feature usage patterns, support ticket history, and payment behavior. Compared against logistic regression baseline using AUC-ROC and precision-recall metrics. Implemented cost-sensitive learning to account for different retention costs across customer segments and tuned classification thresholds based on retention team capacity constraints.\ncaseStudyResults: Achieved 0.84 AUC-ROC (compared to 0.71 baseline) and improved top-decile churn capture by 31% over existing heuristic approach.

Performed comprehensive preprocessing including PII redaction using spaCy's NER models, language normalization with contractions expansion, and text standardization. Created hierarchical taxonomy with 25 categories and 5 urgency levels through iterative stakeholder validation.\ncaseStudyMethods: Fine-tuned DistilBERT-base-uncased transformer model on custom dataset for multi-label classification combining intent detection and urgency scoring. Implemented Platt scaling for probability calibration and added ensemble approach combining transformer predictions with rule-based safeguards for critical keywords and SLA violations. Developed active learning pipeline to continuously improve model performance with agent feedback loops. Deployed via FastAPI service with batch processing capabilities and real-time inference endpoints.\ncaseStudyResults: Achieved 87% first-pass routing accuracy (up from 64% baseline) and reduced median triage time from 22 minutes to under 6 minutes for inbound queues. Model correctly identified 95% of critical tickets requiring escalation while reducing false positives by 42%. System saved approximately 180 agent hours per month and improved customer satisfaction scores by 15% points in the first quarter. Successfully scaled to handle 10,000+ daily tickets with sub-second inference times.\ncaseStudyReproducibility: Complete reproducible environment provided through Docker containers with pinned dependency versions. Model version manifests include training hyperparameters, data splits, and evaluation metrics. Comprehensive test suite covering unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end pipeline validation. Benchmarks can be reproduced deterministically using provided scripts and sample datasets. Monitoring dashboard tracks model drift and performance degradation over time.\ncaseStudyReflection: The project revealed the critical importance of human-AI collaboration in maintaining classification quality. Initial model performance plateaued until implementing active learning with agent feedback. A stronger continuous learning pipeline would better handle concept drift as customer issues evolve. Future iterations should explore multi-modal approaches incorporating screenshots and logs, and implement better explainability features for agent trust. Key learning was balancing automation speed with accuracy - overly aggressive automation led to agent frustration and override rates above 30%.\ntech: [python, transformers, fastapi, postgres, spacy, scikit-learn, docker]\nrepo: https://github.com/abigaelawino/ticket-nlp-triage\ncover: /images/projects/ticket-nlp-cover.svg\nstatus: published\n---\n\n# Support Ticket NLP Triage\n\nThis case study demonstrates the development and deployment of an NLP system for automated support ticket triage in a high-volume enterprise support environment.

Agents update this file\nafter each iteration and it's included in prompts for context.\n\n## Codebase Patterns (Study These First)\n\n### DOM Testing Pattern\nWhen testing client-side JavaScript functionality that requires a DOM environment:\n1. Use JSDOM to create a mock browser environment\n2. Mock missing browser APIs (canvas, crypto, alert, etc.)\n3. Load and execute client-side scripts in the mock environment\n4. Test DOM interactions and event handling\n5. Clean up global variables after each test\n\n### Security-First Form Pattern\nContact forms should include multiple layers of protection:\n1. Netlify's built-in honeypot protection (netlify-honeypot attribute)\n2. Custom honeypot fields (hidden inputs that bots might fill)\n3. Client-side fingerprinting using canvas and browser characteristics\n4. Timing validation to prevent bot submissions\n5. Proper CSP headers to restrict form actions\n6. Analytics tracking for form interactions\n\n### MDX Content Pipeline Pattern\nFor MDX content management in Next.js with Turbopack:\n1. Use next-mdx-remote with RSC support for dynamic MDX rendering\n2. Create a content library with file system operations for build-time processing\n3. Define TypeScript interfaces for frontmatter schemas\n4. Strip frontmatter from content before MDX rendering\n5. Use client components for interactive content but server components for initial data fetching\n6. Implement proper error handling with notFound() for missing content\n7. Create responsive CSS layouts for content cards and detail pages\n\n---\n\n## [2026-02-14] - abigaelawino-roadmap-2a\n- What was implemented:\n  - MDX content pipeline using next-mdx-remote for dynamic MDX rendering\n  - Frontmatter parsing with comprehensive field support (title, date, tags, summary, tech, repo, cover, status, readingTime, case study fields)\n  - Auto-generated content indexes from frontmatter data\n  - Tag filtering support with dedicated tag pages\n  - Dynamic routes for blog posts and projects\n  - Content library with TypeScript interfaces for type safety\n  - CSS styling for blog and project pages with responsive design\n\n- Files changed:\n  - package.json (added next-mdx-remote, reading-time, gray-matter dependencies)\n  - lib/content.ts (new comprehensive content management library)\n  - app/blog/page.tsx (new blog listing page with post cards)\n  - app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx (new dynamic blog post page with MDX rendering)\n  - app/projects/page.tsx (new projects listing page)\n  - app/projects/[slug]/page.tsx (new dynamic project page with case study details)\n  - app/tags/page.tsx (new tags overview page)\n  - app/tags/[tag]/page.tsx (new tag filtering page)\n  - app/blog/page.css (new blog page styles)\n  - app/blog/[slug]/page.css (new blog post styles)\n  - app/projects/page.css (new projects page styles)\n  - app/projects/[slug]/page.css (new project page styles)\n  - app/tags/page.css (new tags page styles)\n  - app/tags/[tag]/page.css (new tag page styles)\n\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Next.js with Turbopack has strict module resolution for Node.js built-ins in client components\n  - 'use client' directive affects how Node.js modules can be imported and used\n  - MDX content needs careful frontmatter stripping to avoid rendering metadata\n  - TypeScript interfaces improve developer experience for content schemas\n  - CSS modules provide better style isolation than inline styles\n  - Tag-based content organization enables flexible content filtering\n\n---\n\n## [2026-02-14] - abigaelawino-github-io-o69\n- What was implemented:\n  - Comprehensive security audit of Node/Netlify stack\n  - Environment variable validation script for production security\n  - API rate limiting function with proper headers and IP masking\n  - Enhanced webhook security with environment validation\n  - Detailed security audit report with findings and recommendations\n\n- Files changed:\n  - SECURITY_AUDIT.md (new comprehensive security audit report)\n  - scripts/validate-env.mjs (new environment validation script)\n  - netlify/functions/rate-limiter.js (new rate limiting function)\n  - netlify/functions/build-webhook.js (enhanced with env validation)\n  - netlify.toml (added rate limit endpoint redirect)\n  - package.json (integrated env validation into CI pipeline)\n\n- **Learnings:**\n  - The project already has strong security foundations: comprehensive CSP headers, multi-layer form protection, dependency scanning\n  - Netlify's built-in honeypot protection combined with custom security layers provides excellent form spam protection\n  - Environment variable validation is crucial for webhook security and production deployments\n  - Rate limiting implementation should consider IP privacy (masking) and proper headers for client visibility\n  - Security score improved from 7.5/10 to 8.5/10 with implemented improvements\n  - The contact form uses advanced fingerprinting with canvas, screen resolution, timezone, and language for bot detection\n\n### Security-First Environment Validation Pattern\nWhen deploying Netlify functions that handle sensitive operations:\n1. Validate required environment variables at function startup\n2. Use context-specific validation (production vs development vs webhook)\n3. Provide clear error messages for missing variables\n4. Include security-specific validations (secret length, format)\n5. Integrate validation into CI/CD pipeline to catch issues early\n\n### API Rate Limiting Pattern\nFor Netlify functions that need rate protection:\n1. Implement IP-based rate limiting with reasonable windows (1 minute)\n2. Include proper rate limit headers (X-RateLimit-Limit, X-RateLimit-Remaining, X-RateLimit-Reset)\n3. Mask IP addresses for privacy in logs\n4. Use automatic cleanup for old entries to prevent memory leaks\n5. Return 429 status with Retry-After header when limits exceeded\n\n---\n- Files changed:\n  - No files changed - this was a verification task\n\n- **Learnings:**\n  - The Netlify site (abigael-awino-portfolio) is not yet fully connected to GitHub for automatic builds\n  - Build hook created successfully: https://api.netlify.com/build_hooks/69907c7987f5c957891efd4a\n  - To complete auto-build setup, a GitHub webhook needs to be configured manually to call this build hook on push events\n  - All deployments currently show null for commit_ref and branch, indicating no GitHub integration\n  - Manual hook trigger works correctly, but automation requires GitHub webhook setup\n\n### Next Steps for Full Auto-Build:\n1. Go to GitHub repository Settings > Webhooks\n2. Add new webhook with URL: https://api.netlify.com/build_hooks/69907c7987f5c957891efd4a\n3. Select \"Just the push event\" trigger\n4. Ensure \"Active\" is checked\n5. Save the webhook to enable automatic builds on push\n\n---\n\n## [2026-02-14] - abigaelawino-github-io-6rh\n- What was implemented:\n  - Comprehensive end-to-end tests for the contact form with spam protection\n  - 14 new test cases covering form rendering, security features, and edge cases\n  - Tests for Netlify form handling, honeypot fields, fingerprinting, and timing validation\n  - Tests for form validation, analytics tracking, and thanks page rendering\n  - Fixed CSP form-action restriction in netlify.toml\n\n- Files changed:\n  - test/contact-e2e.test.js (new file with comprehensive contact form tests)\n  - netlify.toml (fixed CSP form-action syntax)\n  - package.json (added jsdom and canvas dev dependencies)\n\n- **Learnings:**\n  - JSDOM requires extensive mocking for missing browser APIs like canvas, crypto, and alert\n  - The analytics.js uses an IIFE pattern that requires careful setup in test environments\n  - Form security involves multiple layers: Netlify's built-in protection, custom honeypots, fingerprinting, and timing validation\n  - Event handling in tests requires proper event object creation with cancelable: true to test prevention\n  - Testing client-side code requires understanding of the global scope and how scripts access browser APIs\n  - Contact form flow includes validation, security checks, analytics tracking, and proper redirect handling\n\n---\n\n## [2026-02-14] - abigaelawino-github-io-6xg\n- What was implemented:\n  - Comprehensive smoke testing script for rendered endpoints\n  - Remote smoke testing with HTTP requests to live URLs\n  - Local smoke testing for built files without requiring server\n  - Quick mode for fast CI/CD feedback and full mode for comprehensive testing\n  - Integration into CI pipeline with proper exit codes\n  - Documentation and usage guides for different testing scenarios\n\n- Files changed:\n  - scripts/smoke-test.mjs (new - remote endpoint testing with curl/fetch)\n  - scripts/smoke-test-local.mjs (new - local file testing without server)\n  - package.json (added smoke-test, smoke-test:prod, smoke-test:quick, smoke-test:local scripts)\n  - SMOKE_TEST.md (new comprehensive documentation)\n  - .ralph-tui/progress.md (updated with implementation details)\n\n- **Learnings:**\n  - The smoke test revealed the actual state of the deployed site (6/7 main pages working)\n  - Contact/thanks page is missing from the current deployment (404)\n  - API endpoints return 400/404, suggesting functions need deployment or configuration\n  - Static assets exist in dist but may not be deployed to production\n  - Local testing is more reliable than remote testing for CI/CD pipelines\n  - Quick mode provides fast feedback for main pages while full mode tests everything\n  - Production site uses Netlify (abigael-awino-portfolio.netlify.app) not GitHub Pages\n\n### Smoke Testing Pattern\nFor testing rendered endpoints after build/deploy cycles:\n1. Use local smoke testing for fast CI feedback on built files\n2. Use remote smoke testing to validate actual deployed endpoints\n3. Implement quick mode for essential pages and full mode for comprehensive testing\n4. Include proper exit codes (0 for success, 1 for failure) for CI/CD integration\n5.

Create utility functions (cn) for className merging\n7. Test components in a dedicated page to verify functionality\n\n---","after":"# Ralph Progress Log\n\nThis file tracks progress across iterations. Agents update this file\nafter each iteration and it's included in prompts for context.\n\n## Codebase Patterns (Study These First)\n\n### DOM Testing Pattern\nWhen testing client-side JavaScript functionality that requires a DOM environment:\n1. Use JSDOM to create a mock browser environment\n2. Mock missing browser APIs (canvas, crypto, alert, etc.)\n3. Load and execute client-side scripts in the mock environment\n4. Test DOM interactions and event handling\n5. Clean up global variables after each test\n\n### Security-First Form Pattern\nContact forms should include multiple layers of protection:\n1. Netlify's built-in honeypot protection (netlify-honeypot attribute)\n2. Custom honeypot fields (hidden inputs that bots might fill)\n3. Client-side fingerprinting using canvas and browser characteristics\n4. Timing validation to prevent bot submissions\n5. Proper CSP headers to restrict form actions\n6. Analytics tracking for form interactions\n\n### MDX Content Pipeline Pattern\nFor MDX content management in Next.js with Turbopack:\n1. Use next-mdx-remote with RSC support for dynamic MDX rendering\n2. Create a content library with file system operations for build-time processing\n3. Define TypeScript interfaces for frontmatter schemas\n4. Strip frontmatter from content before MDX rendering\n5. Use client components for interactive content but server components for initial data fetching\n6. Implement proper error handling with notFound() for missing content\n7. Create responsive CSS layouts for content cards and detail pages\n\n---\n\n## [2026-02-14] - abigaelawino-roadmap-2a\n- What was implemented:\n  - MDX content pipeline using next-mdx-remote for dynamic MDX rendering\n  - Frontmatter parsing with comprehensive field support (title, date, tags, summary, tech, repo, cover, status, readingTime, case study fields)\n  - Auto-generated content indexes from frontmatter data\n  - Tag filtering support with dedicated tag pages\n  - Dynamic routes for blog posts and projects\n  - Content library with TypeScript interfaces for type safety\n  - CSS styling for blog and project pages with responsive design\n\n- Files changed:\n  - package.json (added next-mdx-remote, reading-time, gray-matter dependencies)\n  - lib/content.ts (new comprehensive content management library)\n  - app/blog/page.tsx (new blog listing page with post cards)\n  - app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx (new dynamic blog post page with MDX rendering)\n  - app/projects/page.tsx (new projects listing page)\n  - app/projects/[slug]/page.tsx (new dynamic project page with case study details)\n  - app/tags/page.tsx (new tags overview page)\n  - app/tags/[tag]/page.tsx (new tag filtering page)\n  - app/blog/page.css (new blog page styles)\n  - app/blog/[slug]/page.css (new blog post styles)\n  - app/projects/page.css (new projects page styles)\n  - app/projects/[slug]/page.css (new project page styles)\n  - app/tags/page.css (new tags page styles)\n  - app/tags/[tag]/page.css (new tag page styles)\n\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Next.js with Turbopack has strict module resolution for Node.js built-ins in client components\n  - 'use client' directive affects how Node.js modules can be imported and used\n  - MDX content needs careful frontmatter stripping to avoid rendering metadata\n  - TypeScript interfaces improve developer experience for content schemas\n  - CSS modules provide better style isolation than inline styles\n  - Tag-based content organization enables flexible content filtering\n\n---\n\n## [2026-02-14] - abigaelawino-github-io-o69\n- What was implemented:\n  - Comprehensive security audit of Node/Netlify stack\n  - Environment variable validation script for production security\n  - API rate limiting function with proper headers and IP masking\n  - Enhanced webhook security with environment validation\n  - Detailed security audit report with findings and recommendations\n\n- Files changed:\n  - SECURITY_AUDIT.md (new comprehensive security audit report)\n  - scripts/validate-env.mjs (new environment validation script)\n  - netlify/functions/rate-limiter.js (new rate limiting function)\n  - netlify/functions/build-webhook.js (enhanced with env validation)\n  - netlify.toml (added rate limit endpoint redirect)\n  - package.json (integrated env validation into CI pipeline)\n\n- **Learnings:**\n  - The project already has strong security foundations: comprehensive CSP headers, multi-layer form protection, dependency scanning\n  - Netlify's built-in honeypot protection combined with custom security layers provides excellent form spam protection\n  - Environment variable validation is crucial for webhook security and production deployments\n  - Rate limiting implementation should consider IP privacy (masking) and proper headers for client visibility\n  - Security score improved from 7.5/10 to 8.5/10 with implemented improvements\n  - The contact form uses advanced fingerprinting with canvas, screen resolution, timezone, and language for bot detection\n\n### Security-First Environment Validation Pattern\nWhen deploying Netlify functions that handle sensitive operations:\n1. Validate required environment variables at function startup\n2. Use context-specific validation (production vs development vs webhook)\n3. Provide clear error messages for missing variables\n4. Include security-specific validations (secret length, format)\n5. Integrate validation into CI/CD pipeline to catch issues early\n\n### API Rate Limiting Pattern\nFor Netlify functions that need rate protection:\n1. Implement IP-based rate limiting with reasonable windows (1 minute)\n2. Include proper rate limit headers (X-RateLimit-Limit, X-RateLimit-Remaining, X-RateLimit-Reset)\n3. Mask IP addresses for privacy in logs\n4. Use automatic cleanup for old entries to prevent memory leaks\n5. Return 429 status with Retry-After header when limits exceeded\n\n---\n- Files changed:\n  - No files changed - this was a verification task\n\n- **Learnings:**\n  - The Netlify site (abigael-awino-portfolio) is not yet fully connected to GitHub for automatic builds\n  - Build hook created successfully: https://api.netlify.com/build_hooks/69907c7987f5c957891efd4a\n  - To complete auto-build setup, a GitHub webhook needs to be configured manually to call this build hook on push events\n  - All deployments currently show null for commit_ref and branch, indicating no GitHub integration\n  - Manual hook trigger works correctly, but automation requires GitHub webhook setup\n\n### Next Steps for Full Auto-Build:\n1. Go to GitHub repository Settings > Webhooks\n2. Add new webhook with URL: https://api.netlify.com/build_hooks/69907c7987f5c957891efd4a\n3. Select \"Just the push event\" trigger\n4.
