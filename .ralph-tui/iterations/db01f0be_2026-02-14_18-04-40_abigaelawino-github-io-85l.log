Agents update this file\n4: after each iteration and it's included in prompts for context.\n5: \n6: ## Codebase Patterns (Study These First)\n7: \n8: - Dependency Security Scanning Pattern: For automated vulnerability management in npm projects:\n9:   1. Use npm audit --json for comprehensive vulnerability detection\n10:   2. Implement risk-based classification (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH) with different handling strategies\n11:   3. Auto-patch low-risk vulnerabilities in safe packages (@types/_, eslint-_, prettier, jest, etc.)\n12:   4. Require manual review for critical packages (next, react, react-dom, express, jsonwebtoken, etc.)\n13:   5. Create weekly GitHub Actions workflow with cron schedule ('0 2 \\* \\* 0' for Sundays 2 AM UTC)\n14:   6. Generate detailed security reports with breakdown by severity and actionable recommendations\n15:   7. Implement notification system for high/critical vulnerabilities via GitHub Issues\n16:   8. Handle npm audit exit codes properly (non-zero when vulnerabilities found)\n17:   9. Use .security-reports/ directory for persistent report storage\n18:   10. Integrate with CI/CD pipeline for automated security gates\n19: \n20: - Form Implementation Pattern: Netlify Forms with Next.js require:\n21:   1. Static HTML form definitions in `public/__forms.html` for deploy-time detection\n22:   2. Client-side React components with fetch POST to `/__forms.html`\n23:   3. Form state handling (idle/pending/success/error) with user feedback\n24:   4. Hidden fields for form-name and bot-field (honeypot)\n25:   5. URLSearchParams for form data encoding\n26: - CMS Selection Pattern: For developer portfolios with Next.js + Netlify stack:\n27:   1. Decap CMS (formerly Netlify CMS) is optimal for Git-based workflows\n28:   2. Requires only 2 files: admin/index.html and admin/config.yml\n29:   3. Content stored as markdown with frontmatter in repository\n30:   4. Integrates with Netlify Identity for authentication\n31:   5. No additional infrastructure or costs required\n32: - Build Output Pattern: For static site deployment, the dist/ folder should contain only:\n33:   1. Generated HTML files (pages and posts)\n34:   2. Assets (CSS, JS, images, fonts)\n35:   3. Downloadable files (PDF resume, etc.)\n36:   4. SEO files (sitemap.xml, robots.txt)\n37:   5. Should NOT contain raw source directories (src/, content/)\n38: - Lighthouse Verification Pattern: For comprehensive Lighthouse score verification:\n39:   1. Use static HTML analysis for accurate scoring when Chrome/Headless browsers unavailable\n40:   2. Focus on the built static files (dist/) rather than live Next.js runtime\n41:   3. Verify all four categories: Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, SEO\n42:   4. Score calculation should be: actual issues \\* penalty points, not binary failures\n43:   5. Small variations (like meta description length) are acceptable if scores ≥ 90\n44:   6. Production vs development verification: static build may have different structure than runtime\n45: - Shell Styles Centralization Pattern: For static render helpers with component-specific styles:\n46:   1. Move inline <style> blocks from render functions to build.mjs SHELL_CSS constant\n47:   2. Ensure all component styles use shadcn/ui design tokens and follow PORTFOLIO_PLAN visual system\n48:   3. Include responsive design patterns in centralized shell CSS\n49:   4. Eliminates duplication and ensures consistent styling across all pages\n50:   5. Build script automatically generates shell.css with all centralized styles\n51: - Sticky Navigation Implementation Pattern: For portfolio websites with clear CTAs:\n52:   1. Use shadcn/ui Navigation Menu component with mobile-first responsive design\n53:   2. Implement sticky positioning with backdrop-blur for modern glassmorphism effect\n54:   3. Separate primary CTAs (Contact, Resume) visually with distinct button variants\n55:   4. Include mobile hamburger menu with proper state management\n56:   5. Add skip-to-content link for accessibility\n57:   6. Ensure responsive breakpoints for 360-414px mobile widths\n58: - Privacy-Friendly Analytics Implementation Pattern: For GDPR-compliant analytics without cookies:\n59:   1. Use Plausible Analytics with script injection via build.mjs for production\n60:   2. Implement automatic Do Not Track (DNT) detection and respect user preferences\n61:   3. Add data-analytics-event attributes to CTAs and navigation elements\n62:   4. Track per-page events automatically: pageviews, scroll depth, time on page\n63:   5. Track outbound links and file downloads without cookies or personal data\n64:   6. Use nonce-based CSP for secure script execution\n65:   7. Include analytics.js with custom event tracking for user interactions\n66: - Netlify Performance Monitoring Pattern: For comprehensive automated performance tracking and optimization:\n67:   1. Use Netlify CLI API integration for automated log fetching and analysis\n68:   2. Implement risk-based performance classification with health scores and trend analysis\n69:   3. Auto-detect performance issues with build time thresholds and error pattern analysis\n70:   4. Require manual review for critical performance degradation and recurring errors\n71:   5. Create weekly GitHub Actions workflow with cron schedule ('0 2 \\* \\* 0' for Sundays 2 AM UTC)\n72:   6. Generate detailed performance reports with trends, optimization opportunities, and actionable recommendations\n73:   7. Implement notification system for critical performance issues via GitHub Issues\n74:   8. Handle Netlify API errors and build log parsing with proper error handling and fallbacks\n75:   9. Use .netlify-reports/ directory for persistent report storage and dashboard generation\n76:   10. Integrate with CI/CD pipeline for automated performance gates and continuous monitoring\n77: - Content Freshness Monitoring Pattern: For automated content quality management and maintenance:\n78:   1. Implement content age analysis with different thresholds by content type (blog/projects/certifications)\n79:   2. Use risk-based content classification (FRESH/AGING/STALE/EXPIRED) with priority-based handling\n80:   3. Detect temporal keywords and time-sensitive language requiring priority updates\n81:   4. Generate specific, actionable recommendations with update templates and bulk operations\n82:   5. Create monthly trend analysis with historical tracking and strategic insights\n83:   6. Implement quarterly maintenance scheduling with goals and monthly breakdowns\n84:   7. Use content health scoring system with visual badges and comprehensive validation\n85:   8. Create automated GitHub Actions workflow with monthly triggers and manual dispatch options\n86:   9. Generate multiple report formats (JSON/Markdown) for different use cases and stakeholders\n87:   10. Integrate with CI/CD pipeline for automated content quality gates and continuous monitoring\n88: - Ralph TUI Queue Health Monitoring Pattern: For comprehensive queue monitoring and bead aging management:\n89:   1. Use queue depth tracking with configurable thresholds (maxQueueDepth: 50 beads)\n90:   2. Implement processing rate analysis with minimum rate thresholds (minProcessingRate: 0.5 beads/min)\n91:   3. Auto-detect stuck beads with time-based analysis (maxStuckTime: 1 hour)\n92:   4. Monitor daemon health with PID checking and activity timestamp validation\n93:   5. Implement socket connectivity testing for communication channels\n94:   6. Create ASCII-based real-time dashboard with performance metrics and alerts\n95:   7. Use bead aging categorization (Fresh: 1d, Aging: 3d, Stale: 7d, Critical: 14d)\n96:   8. Generate trend analysis with processing rates and queue depth patterns\n97:   9. Implement intelligent alerting with cooldown periods to prevent spam\n98:   10. Create automated GitHub Actions workflow with 30-minute intervals and issue creation\n99: - Lighthouse Score Tracking Pattern: For comprehensive automated performance monitoring and regression detection:\n100:   1. Use weekly GitHub Actions workflow with cron schedule ('0 2 \\* \\* 0' for Sundays 2 AM UTC) for consistent monitoring\n101:   2. Implement Core Web Vitals monitoring with threshold-based alerting (LCP: <2.5s, FID: <100ms, CLS: <0.1)\n102:   3. Create trend analysis with regression detection (>5 point drop considered significant, >10 point critical)\n103:   4. Build monthly optimization recommendations engine with impact/effort prioritization and implementation tracking\n104:   5. Implement intelligent alert system with cooldown periods (critical: 4 hours, warnings: 24 hours) to prevent spam\n105:   6. Use ASCII-based dashboards for real-time performance visualization without external dependencies\n106:   7. Store historical data in JSON format for trend analysis and pattern detection across multiple time periods\n107:   8. Create GitHub issues automatically for performance regressions with severity-based labels and recommendations\n108:   9. Generate comprehensive monthly reports with success metrics, implementation timelines, and progress tracking\n109:   10. Integrate with CI/CD pipeline for automated performance gates and continuous monitoring of all pages\n110: \n111: ---\n112: \n113: ## [2026-02-14] - abigaelawino-github-io-429\n114: \n115: - Implemented comprehensive MCP server health monitoring system for Ralph TUI\n116: -

Automated issue creation for critical content ensures timely updates and maintains content quality\n736:   - Health scoring system with visual badges makes content status easily understandable at a glance\n737:   - Quarterly planning with monthly breakdowns provides structured approach to content maintenance\n738:   - Comprehensive documentation with examples and troubleshooting is essential for complex automation systems\n739:   - Integration with existing CI/CD patterns ensures consistent monitoring across all project aspects\n740: \n741: ---\n742: \n743: - Implemented comprehensive Ralph TUI queue health monitoring system with real-time dashboard and automated alerting\n744: -

Use npm audit --json for comprehensive vulnerability detection\n  2. Implement risk-based classification (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH) with different handling strategies\n  3. Auto-patch low-risk vulnerabilities in safe packages (@types/_, eslint-_, prettier, jest, etc.)\n  4. Require manual review for critical packages (next, react, react-dom, express, jsonwebtoken, etc.)\n  5. Create weekly GitHub Actions workflow with cron schedule ('0 2 \\* \\* 0' for Sundays 2 AM UTC)\n  6. Generate detailed security reports with breakdown by severity and actionable recommendations\n  7. Implement notification system for high/critical vulnerabilities via GitHub Issues\n  8. Handle npm audit exit codes properly (non-zero when vulnerabilities found)\n  9. Use .security-reports/ directory for persistent report storage\n  10. Integrate with CI/CD pipeline for automated security gates\n\n- Form Implementation Pattern: Netlify Forms with Next.js require:","truncated":true,"loaded":[]},"time":{"start":1771110302140,"end":1771110302143}}}}

Agents update this file\n4: after each iteration and it's included in prompts for context.\n5: \n6: ## Codebase Patterns (Study These First)\n7: \n8: - Dependency Security Scanning Pattern: For automated vulnerability management in npm projects:\n9:   1. Use npm audit --json for comprehensive vulnerability detection\n10:   2. Implement risk-based classification (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH) with different handling strategies\n11:   3. Auto-patch low-risk vulnerabilities in safe packages (@types/_, eslint-_, prettier, jest, etc.)\n12:   4. Require manual review for critical packages (next, react, react-dom, express, jsonwebtoken, etc.)\n13:   5. Create weekly GitHub Actions workflow with cron schedule ('0 2 \\* \\* 0' for Sundays 2 AM UTC)\n14:   6. Generate detailed security reports with breakdown by severity and actionable recommendations\n15:   7. Implement notification system for high/critical vulnerabilities via GitHub Issues\n16:   8. Handle npm audit exit codes properly (non-zero when vulnerabilities found)\n17:   9. Use .security-reports/ directory for persistent report storage\n18:   10. Integrate with CI/CD pipeline for automated security gates\n19: \n20: - Form Implementation Pattern: Netlify Forms with Next.js require:\n21:   1. Static HTML form definitions in `public/__forms.html` for deploy-time detection\n22:   2. Client-side React components with fetch POST to `/__forms.html`\n23:   3. Form state handling (idle/pending/success/error) with user feedback\n24:   4. Hidden fields for form-name and bot-field (honeypot)\n25:   5. URLSearchParams for form data encoding\n26: - CMS Selection Pattern: For developer portfolios with Next.js + Netlify stack:\n27:   1. Decap CMS (formerly Netlify CMS) is optimal for Git-based workflows\n28:   2. Requires only 2 files: admin/index.html and admin/config.yml\n29:   3. Content stored as markdown with frontmatter in repository\n30:   4. Integrates with Netlify Identity for authentication\n31:   5. No additional infrastructure or costs required\n32: - Build Output Pattern: For static site deployment, the dist/ folder should contain only:\n33:   1. Generated HTML files (pages and posts)\n34:   2. Assets (CSS, JS, images, fonts)\n35:   3. Downloadable files (PDF resume, etc.)\n36:   4. SEO files (sitemap.xml, robots.txt)\n37:   5. Should NOT contain raw source directories (src/, content/)\n38: - Lighthouse Verification Pattern: For comprehensive Lighthouse score verification:\n39:   1. Use static HTML analysis for accurate scoring when Chrome/Headless browsers unavailable\n40:   2. Focus on the built static files (dist/) rather than live Next.js runtime\n41:   3. Verify all four categories: Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, SEO\n42:   4. Score calculation should be: actual issues \\* penalty points, not binary failures\n43:   5. Small variations (like meta description length) are acceptable if scores ≥ 90\n44:   6. Production vs development verification: static build may have different structure than runtime\n45: - Shell Styles Centralization Pattern: For static render helpers with component-specific styles:\n46:   1. Move inline <style> blocks from render functions to build.mjs SHELL_CSS constant\n47:   2. Ensure all component styles use shadcn/ui design tokens and follow PORTFOLIO_PLAN visual system\n48:   3. Include responsive design patterns in centralized shell CSS\n49:   4. Eliminates duplication and ensures consistent styling across all pages\n50:   5. Build script automatically generates shell.css with all centralized styles\n51: - Sticky Navigation Implementation Pattern: For portfolio websites with clear CTAs:\n52:   1. Use shadcn/ui Navigation Menu component with mobile-first responsive design\n53:   2. Implement sticky positioning with backdrop-blur for modern glassmorphism effect\n54:   3. Separate primary CTAs (Contact, Resume) visually with distinct button variants\n55:   4. Include mobile hamburger menu with proper state management\n56:   5. Add skip-to-content link for accessibility\n57:   6. Ensure responsive breakpoints for 360-414px mobile widths\n58: - Privacy-Friendly Analytics Implementation Pattern: For GDPR-compliant analytics without cookies:\n59:   1. Use Plausible Analytics with script injection via build.mjs for production\n60:   2. Implement automatic Do Not Track (DNT) detection and respect user preferences\n61:   3. Add data-analytics-event attributes to CTAs and navigation elements\n62:   4. Track per-page events automatically: pageviews, scroll depth, time on page\n63:   5. Track outbound links and file downloads without cookies or personal data\n64:   6. Use nonce-based CSP for secure script execution\n65:   7. Include analytics.js with custom event tracking for user interactions\n66: - Netlify Performance Monitoring Pattern: For comprehensive automated performance tracking and optimization:\n67:   1. Use Netlify CLI API integration for automated log fetching and analysis\n68:   2. Implement risk-based performance classification with health scores and trend analysis\n69:   3. Auto-detect performance issues with build time thresholds and error pattern analysis\n70:   4. Require manual review for critical performance degradation and recurring errors\n71:   5. Create weekly GitHub Actions workflow with cron schedule ('0 2 \\* \\* 0' for Sundays 2 AM UTC)\n72:   6. Generate detailed performance reports with trends, optimization opportunities, and actionable recommendations\n73:   7. Implement notification system for critical performance issues via GitHub Issues\n74:   8. Handle Netlify API errors and build log parsing with proper error handling and fallbacks\n75:   9. Use .netlify-reports/ directory for persistent report storage and dashboard generation\n76:   10. Integrate with CI/CD pipeline for automated performance gates and continuous monitoring\n77: - Content Freshness Monitoring Pattern: For automated content quality management and maintenance:\n78:   1. Implement content age analysis with different thresholds by content type (blog/projects/certifications)\n79:   2. Use risk-based content classification (FRESH/AGING/STALE/EXPIRED) with priority-based handling\n80:   3. Detect temporal keywords and time-sensitive language requiring priority updates\n81:   4. Generate specific, actionable recommendations with update templates and bulk operations\n82:   5. Create monthly trend analysis with historical tracking and strategic insights\n83:   6. Implement quarterly maintenance scheduling with goals and monthly breakdowns\n84:   7. Use content health scoring system with visual badges and comprehensive validation\n85:   8. Create automated GitHub Actions workflow with monthly triggers and manual dispatch options\n86:   9. Generate multiple report formats (JSON/Markdown) for different use cases and stakeholders\n87:   10. Integrate with CI/CD pipeline for automated content quality gates and continuous monitoring\n88: - Ralph TUI Queue Health Monitoring Pattern: For comprehensive queue monitoring and bead aging management:\n89:   1. Use queue depth tracking with configurable thresholds (maxQueueDepth: 50 beads)\n90:   2. Implement processing rate analysis with minimum rate thresholds (minProcessingRate: 0.5 beads/min)\n91:   3. Auto-detect stuck beads with time-based analysis (maxStuckTime: 1 hour)\n92:   4. Monitor daemon health with PID checking and activity timestamp validation\n93:   5. Implement socket connectivity testing for communication channels\n94:   6. Create ASCII-based real-time dashboard with performance metrics and alerts\n95:   7. Use bead aging categorization (Fresh: 1d, Aging: 3d, Stale: 7d, Critical: 14d)\n96:   8. Generate trend analysis with processing rates and queue depth patterns\n97:   9. Implement intelligent alerting with cooldown periods to prevent spam\n98:   10. Create automated GitHub Actions workflow with 30-minute intervals and issue creation\n99: - Lighthouse Score Tracking Pattern: For comprehensive automated performance monitoring and regression detection:\n100:   1. Use weekly GitHub Actions workflow with cron schedule ('0 2 \\* \\* 0' for Sundays 2 AM UTC) for consistent monitoring\n101:   2. Implement Core Web Vitals monitoring with threshold-based alerting (LCP: <2.5s, FID: <100ms, CLS: <0.1)\n102:   3. Create trend analysis with regression detection (>5 point drop considered significant, >10 point critical)\n103:   4. Build monthly optimization recommendations engine with impact/effort prioritization and implementation tracking\n104:   5. Implement intelligent alert system with cooldown periods (critical: 4 hours, warnings: 24 hours) to prevent spam\n105:   6. Use ASCII-based dashboards for real-time performance visualization without external dependencies\n106:   7. Store historical data in JSON format for trend analysis and pattern detection across multiple time periods\n107:   8. Create GitHub issues automatically for performance regressions with severity-based labels and recommendations\n108:   9. Generate comprehensive monthly reports with success metrics, implementation timelines, and progress tracking\n109:   10. Integrate with CI/CD pipeline for automated performance gates and continuous monitoring of all pages\n110: \n\n(File has more lines.

Agents update this file\nafter each iteration and it's included in prompts for context.\n\n## Codebase Patterns (Study These First)\n\n- Dependency Security Scanning Pattern: For automated vulnerability management in npm projects:\n  1. Use npm audit --json for comprehensive vulnerability detection\n  2. Implement risk-based classification (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH) with different handling strategies\n  3. Auto-patch low-risk vulnerabilities in safe packages (@types/_, eslint-_, prettier, jest, etc.)\n  4. Require manual review for critical packages (next, react, react-dom, express, jsonwebtoken, etc.)\n  5. Create weekly GitHub Actions workflow with cron schedule ('0 2 \\* \\* 0' for Sundays 2 AM UTC)\n  6. Generate detailed security reports with breakdown by severity and actionable recommendations\n  7. Implement notification system for high/critical vulnerabilities via GitHub Issues\n  8. Handle npm audit exit codes properly (non-zero when vulnerabilities found)\n  9. Use .security-reports/ directory for persistent report storage\n  10. Integrate with CI/CD pipeline for automated security gates\n\n- Form Implementation Pattern: Netlify Forms with Next.js require:\n  1. Static HTML form definitions in `public/__forms.html` for deploy-time detection\n  2. Client-side React components with fetch POST to `/__forms.html`\n  3. Form state handling (idle/pending/success/error) with user feedback\n  4. Hidden fields for form-name and bot-field (honeypot)\n  5. URLSearchParams for form data encoding\n- CMS Selection Pattern: For developer portfolios with Next.js + Netlify stack:\n  1. Decap CMS (formerly Netlify CMS) is optimal for Git-based workflows\n  2. Requires only 2 files: admin/index.html and admin/config.yml\n  3. Content stored as markdown with frontmatter in repository\n  4. Integrates with Netlify Identity for authentication\n  5. No additional infrastructure or costs required\n- Build Output Pattern: For static site deployment, the dist/ folder should contain only:\n  1. Generated HTML files (pages and posts)\n  2. Assets (CSS, JS, images, fonts)\n  3. Downloadable files (PDF resume, etc.)\n  4. SEO files (sitemap.xml, robots.txt)\n  5. Should NOT contain raw source directories (src/, content/)\n- Lighthouse Verification Pattern: For comprehensive Lighthouse score verification:\n  1. Use static HTML analysis for accurate scoring when Chrome/Headless browsers unavailable\n  2. Focus on the built static files (dist/) rather than live Next.js runtime\n  3. Verify all four categories: Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, SEO\n  4. Score calculation should be: actual issues \\* penalty points, not binary failures\n  5. Small variations (like meta description length) are acceptable if scores ≥ 90\n  6. Production vs development verification: static build may have different structure than runtime\n- Shell Styles Centralization Pattern: For static render helpers with component-specific styles:\n  1. Move inline <style> blocks from render functions to build.mjs SHELL_CSS constant\n  2. Ensure all component styles use shadcn/ui design tokens and follow PORTFOLIO_PLAN visual system\n  3. Include responsive design patterns in centralized shell CSS\n  4. Eliminates duplication and ensures consistent styling across all pages\n  5. Build script automatically generates shell.css with all centralized styles\n- Sticky Navigation Implementation Pattern: For portfolio websites with clear CTAs:\n  1. Use shadcn/ui Navigation Menu component with mobile-first responsive design\n  2. Implement sticky positioning with backdrop-blur for modern glassmorphism effect\n  3. Separate primary CTAs (Contact, Resume) visually with distinct button variants\n  4. Include mobile hamburger menu with proper state management\n  5. Add skip-to-content link for accessibility\n  6. Ensure responsive breakpoints for 360-414px mobile widths\n- Privacy-Friendly Analytics Implementation Pattern: For GDPR-compliant analytics without cookies:\n  1. Use Plausible Analytics with script injection via build.mjs for production\n  2. Implement automatic Do Not Track (DNT) detection and respect user preferences\n  3. Add data-analytics-event attributes to CTAs and navigation elements\n  4. Track per-page events automatically: pageviews, scroll depth, time on page\n  5. Track outbound links and file downloads without cookies or personal data\n  6. Use nonce-based CSP for secure script execution\n  7. Include analytics.js with custom event tracking for user interactions\n- Netlify Performance Monitoring Pattern: For comprehensive automated performance tracking and optimization:\n  1. Use Netlify CLI API integration for automated log fetching and analysis\n  2. Implement risk-based performance classification with health scores and trend analysis\n  3. Auto-detect performance issues with build time thresholds and error pattern analysis\n  4. Require manual review for critical performance degradation and recurring errors\n  5. Create weekly GitHub Actions workflow with cron schedule ('0 2 \\* \\* 0' for Sundays 2 AM UTC)\n  6. Generate detailed performance reports with trends, optimization opportunities, and actionable recommendations\n  7. Implement notification system for critical performance issues via GitHub Issues\n  8. Handle Netlify API errors and build log parsing with proper error handling and fallbacks\n  9. Use .netlify-reports/ directory for persistent report storage and dashboard generation\n  10. Integrate with CI/CD pipeline for automated performance gates and continuous monitoring\n- Content Freshness Monitoring Pattern: For automated content quality management and maintenance:\n  1. Implement content age analysis with different thresholds by content type (blog/projects/certifications)\n  2. Use risk-based content classification (FRESH/AGING/STALE/EXPIRED) with priority-based handling\n  3. Detect temporal keywords and time-sensitive language requiring priority updates\n  4. Generate specific, actionable recommendations with update templates and bulk operations\n  5. Create monthly trend analysis with historical tracking and strategic insights\n  6. Implement quarterly maintenance scheduling with goals and monthly breakdowns\n  7. Use content health scoring system with visual badges and comprehensive validation\n  8. Create automated GitHub Actions workflow with monthly triggers and manual dispatch options\n  9. Generate multiple report formats (JSON/Markdown) for different use cases and stakeholders\n  10. Integrate with CI/CD pipeline for automated content quality gates and continuous monitoring\n- Ralph TUI Queue Health Monitoring Pattern: For comprehensive queue monitoring and bead aging management:\n  1. Use queue depth tracking with configurable thresholds (maxQueueDepth: 50 beads)\n  2. Implement processing rate analysis with minimum rate thresholds (minProcessingRate: 0.5 beads/min)\n  3. Auto-detect stuck beads with time-based analysis (maxStuckTime: 1 hour)\n  4. Monitor daemon health with PID checking and activity timestamp validation\n  5. Implement socket connectivity testing for communication channels\n  6. Create ASCII-based real-time dashboard with performance metrics and alerts\n  7. Use bead aging categorization (Fresh: 1d, Aging: 3d, Stale: 7d, Critical: 14d)\n  8. Generate trend analysis with processing rates and queue depth patterns\n  9. Implement intelligent alerting with cooldown periods to prevent spam\n  10. Create automated GitHub Actions workflow with 30-minute intervals and issue creation\n- Lighthouse Score Tracking Pattern: For comprehensive automated performance monitoring and regression detection:\n  1. Use weekly GitHub Actions workflow with cron schedule ('0 2 \\* \\* 0' for Sundays 2 AM UTC) for consistent monitoring\n  2. Implement Core Web Vitals monitoring with threshold-based alerting (LCP: <2.5s, FID: <100ms, CLS: <0.1)\n  3. Create trend analysis with regression detection (>5 point drop considered significant, >10 point critical)\n  4. Build monthly optimization recommendations engine with impact/effort prioritization and implementation tracking\n  5. Implement intelligent alert system with cooldown periods (critical: 4 hours, warnings: 24 hours) to prevent spam\n  6. Use ASCII-based dashboards for real-time performance visualization without external dependencies\n  7. Store historical data in JSON format for trend analysis and pattern detection across multiple time periods\n  8. Create GitHub issues automatically for performance regressions with severity-based labels and recommendations\n  9. Generate comprehensive monthly reports with success metrics, implementation timelines, and progress tracking\n  10. Integrate with CI/CD pipeline for automated performance gates and continuous monitoring of all pages\n\n---\n\n## [2026-02-14] - abigaelawino-github-io-429\n\n- Implemented comprehensive MCP server health monitoring system for Ralph TUI\n- Created monitoring script with health checks, response time tracking, and error rate monitoring\n- Added real-time ASCII dashboard displaying server status, alerts, and performance metrics\n- Set up automated alerts for server downtime and performance degradation with cooldown periods\n- Implemented GitHub Actions workflow for continuous monitoring every 5 minutes with issue creation\n- Added comprehensive test suite covering all monitoring components and failure scenarios\n- Created detailed documentation with configuration, usage, and troubleshooting guides\n- Files changed:\n  -

Agents update this file\nafter each iteration and it's included in prompts for context.\n\n## Codebase Patterns (Study These First)\n\n- Dependency Security Scanning Pattern: For automated vulnerability management in npm projects:\n  1. Use npm audit --json for comprehensive vulnerability detection\n  2. Implement risk-based classification (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH) with different handling strategies\n  3. Auto-patch low-risk vulnerabilities in safe packages (@types/_, eslint-_, prettier, jest, etc.)\n  4. Require manual review for critical packages (next, react, react-dom, express, jsonwebtoken, etc.)\n  5. Create weekly GitHub Actions workflow with cron schedule ('0 2 \\* \\* 0' for Sundays 2 AM UTC)\n  6. Generate detailed security reports with breakdown by severity and actionable recommendations\n  7. Implement notification system for high/critical vulnerabilities via GitHub Issues\n  8. Handle npm audit exit codes properly (non-zero when vulnerabilities found)\n  9. Use .security-reports/ directory for persistent report storage\n  10. Integrate with CI/CD pipeline for automated security gates\n\n- Form Implementation Pattern: Netlify Forms with Next.js require:\n  1. Static HTML form definitions in `public/__forms.html` for deploy-time detection\n  2. Client-side React components with fetch POST to `/__forms.html`\n  3.

Agents update this file\nafter each iteration and it's included in prompts for context.\n\n## Codebase Patterns (Study These First)\n\n- Dependency Security Scanning Pattern: For automated vulnerability management in npm projects:\n  1. Use npm audit --json for comprehensive vulnerability detection\n  2. Implement risk-based classification (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH) with different handling strategies\n  3. Auto-patch low-risk vulnerabilities in safe packages (@types/_, eslint-_, prettier, jest, etc.)\n  4. Require manual review for critical packages (next, react, react-dom, express, jsonwebtoken, etc.)\n  5. Create weekly GitHub Actions workflow with cron schedule ('0 2 \\* \\* 0' for Sundays 2 AM UTC)\n  6. Generate detailed security reports with breakdown by severity and actionable recommendations\n  7. Implement notification system for high/critical vulnerabilities via GitHub Issues\n  8. Handle npm audit exit codes properly (non-zero when vulnerabilities found)\n  9. Use .security-reports/ directory for persistent report storage\n  10. Integrate with CI/CD pipeline for automated security gates\n\n- Form Implementation Pattern: Netlify Forms with Next.js require:\n  1. Static HTML form definitions in `public/__forms.html` for deploy-time detection\n  2. Client-side React components with fetch POST to `/__forms.html`\n  3. Form state handling (idle/pending/success/error) with user feedback\n  4. Hidden fields for form-name and bot-field (honeypot)\n  5. URLSearchParams for form data encoding\n- CMS Selection Pattern: For developer portfolios with Next.js + Netlify stack:\n  1. Decap CMS (formerly Netlify CMS) is optimal for Git-based workflows\n  2. Requires only 2 files: admin/index.html and admin/config.yml\n  3. Content stored as markdown with frontmatter in repository\n  4. Integrates with Netlify Identity for authentication\n  5. No additional infrastructure or costs required\n- Build Output Pattern: For static site deployment, the dist/ folder should contain only:\n  1. Generated HTML files (pages and posts)\n  2. Assets (CSS, JS, images, fonts)\n  3. Downloadable files (PDF resume, etc.)\n  4. SEO files (sitemap.xml, robots.txt)\n  5. Should NOT contain raw source directories (src/, content/)\n- Lighthouse Verification Pattern: For comprehensive Lighthouse score verification:\n  1. Use static HTML analysis for accurate scoring when Chrome/Headless browsers unavailable\n  2. Focus on the built static files (dist/) rather than live Next.js runtime\n  3. Verify all four categories: Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, SEO\n  4. Score calculation should be: actual issues \\* penalty points, not binary failures\n  5. Small variations (like meta description length) are acceptable if scores ≥ 90\n  6. Production vs development verification: static build may have different structure than runtime\n- Shell Styles Centralization Pattern: For static render helpers with component-specific styles:\n  1. Move inline <style> blocks from render functions to build.mjs SHELL_CSS constant\n  2. Ensure all component styles use shadcn/ui design tokens and follow PORTFOLIO_PLAN visual system\n  3. Include responsive design patterns in centralized shell CSS\n  4. Eliminates duplication and ensures consistent styling across all pages\n  5. Build script automatically generates shell.css with all centralized styles\n- Sticky Navigation Implementation Pattern: For portfolio websites with clear CTAs:\n  1. Use shadcn/ui Navigation Menu component with mobile-first responsive design\n  2. Implement sticky positioning with backdrop-blur for modern glassmorphism effect\n  3. Separate primary CTAs (Contact, Resume) visually with distinct button variants\n  4. Include mobile hamburger menu with proper state management\n  5. Add skip-to-content link for accessibility\n  6. Ensure responsive breakpoints for 360-414px mobile widths\n- Privacy-Friendly Analytics Implementation Pattern: For GDPR-compliant analytics without cookies:\n  1. Use Plausible Analytics with script injection via build.mjs for production\n  2. Implement automatic Do Not Track (DNT) detection and respect user preferences\n  3. Add data-analytics-event attributes to CTAs and navigation elements\n  4. Track per-page events automatically: pageviews, scroll depth, time on page\n  5. Track outbound links and file downloads without cookies or personal data\n  6. Use nonce-based CSP for secure script execution\n  7. Include analytics.js with custom event tracking for user interactions\n- Netlify Performance Monitoring Pattern: For comprehensive automated performance tracking and optimization:\n  1. Use Netlify CLI API integration for automated log fetching and analysis\n  2. Implement risk-based performance classification with health scores and trend analysis\n  3. Auto-detect performance issues with build time thresholds and error pattern analysis\n  4. Require manual review for critical performance degradation and recurring errors\n  5. Create weekly GitHub Actions workflow with cron schedule ('0 2 \\* \\* 0' for Sundays 2 AM UTC)\n  6. Generate detailed performance reports with trends, optimization opportunities, and actionable recommendations\n  7. Implement notification system for critical performance issues via GitHub Issues\n  8. Handle Netlify API errors and build log parsing with proper error handling and fallbacks\n  9. Use .netlify-reports/ directory for persistent report storage and dashboard generation\n  10. Integrate with CI/CD pipeline for automated performance gates and continuous monitoring\n- Content Freshness Monitoring Pattern: For automated content quality management and maintenance:\n  1. Implement content age analysis with different thresholds by content type (blog/projects/certifications)\n  2. Use risk-based content classification (FRESH/AGING/STALE/EXPIRED) with priority-based handling\n  3. Detect temporal keywords and time-sensitive language requiring priority updates\n  4. Generate specific, actionable recommendations with update templates and bulk operations\n  5. Create monthly trend analysis with historical tracking and strategic insights\n  6. Implement quarterly maintenance scheduling with goals and monthly breakdowns\n  7. Use content health scoring system with visual badges and comprehensive validation\n  8. Create automated GitHub Actions workflow with monthly triggers and manual dispatch options\n  9. Generate multiple report formats (JSON/Markdown) for different use cases and stakeholders\n  10. Integrate with CI/CD pipeline for automated content quality gates and continuous monitoring\n- Ralph TUI Queue Health Monitoring Pattern: For comprehensive queue monitoring and bead aging management:\n  1. Use queue depth tracking with configurable thresholds (maxQueueDepth: 50 beads)\n  2. Implement processing rate analysis with minimum rate thresholds (minProcessingRate: 0.5 beads/min)\n  3. Auto-detect stuck beads with time-based analysis (maxStuckTime: 1 hour)\n  4. Monitor daemon health with PID checking and activity timestamp validation\n  5. Implement socket connectivity testing for communication channels\n  6. Create ASCII-based real-time dashboard with performance metrics and alerts\n  7. Use bead aging categorization (Fresh: 1d, Aging: 3d, Stale: 7d, Critical: 14d)\n  8. Generate trend analysis with processing rates and queue depth patterns\n  9. Implement intelligent alerting with cooldown periods to prevent spam\n  10. Create automated GitHub Actions workflow with 30-minute intervals and issue creation\n- Netlify Function Health Monitoring Pattern: For comprehensive function monitoring and performance tracking:\n  1. Use execution time tracking with configurable thresholds (warning: 3s, critical: 5s) for performance monitoring\n  2. Implement error rate monitoring with percentage-based alerting (warning: 5%, critical: 10%) for reliability tracking\n  3. Auto-detect cold start frequency with rate analysis (warning: 20%, critical: 30%) for efficiency optimization\n  4. Monitor function availability with uptime tracking (warning: 95%, critical: 90%) for service health\n  5. Create real-time ASCII dashboard with auto-refresh and interactive modes for live monitoring\n  6. Implement intelligent alerting system with cooldown periods (critical: 4h, warning: 24h, performance: 12h) to prevent spam\n  7. Use multi-channel notifications (console, GitHub Issues, Slack) for comprehensive alert coverage\n  8. Store historical metrics in JSON format for trend analysis and performance pattern detection\n  9. Create automated GitHub Actions workflow with 30-minute intervals for continuous monitoring\n  10. Integrate with CI/CD pipeline for automated function health gates and deployment validation\n- Lighthouse Score Tracking Pattern: For comprehensive automated performance monitoring and regression detection:\n  1. Use weekly GitHub Actions workflow with cron schedule ('0 2 \\* \\* 0' for Sundays 2 AM UTC) for consistent monitoring\n  2. Implement Core Web Vitals monitoring with threshold-based alerting (LCP: <2.5s, FID: <100ms, CLS: <0.1)\n  3. Create trend analysis with regression detection (>5 point drop considered significant, >10 point critical)\n  4. Build monthly optimization recommendations engine with impact/effort prioritization and implementation tracking\n  5. Implement intelligent alert system with cooldown periods (critical: 4 hours, warnings: 24 hours) to prevent spam\n  6. Use ASCII-based dashboards for real-time performance visualization without external dependencies\n  7. Store historical data in JSON format for trend analysis and pattern detection across multiple time periods\n  8. Create GitHub issues automatically for performance regressions with severity-based labels and recommendations\n  9. Generate comprehensive monthly reports with success metrics, implementation timelines, and progress tracking\n  10.

Agents update this file\nafter each iteration and it's included in prompts for context.\n\n## Codebase Patterns (Study These First)\n\n- Dependency Security Scanning Pattern: For automated vulnerability management in npm projects:\n  1. Use npm audit --json for comprehensive vulnerability detection\n  2. Implement risk-based classification (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH) with different handling strategies\n  3. Auto-patch low-risk vulnerabilities in safe packages (@types/_, eslint-_, prettier, jest, etc.)\n  4. Require manual review for critical packages (next, react, react-dom, express, jsonwebtoken, etc.)\n  5. Create weekly GitHub Actions workflow with cron schedule ('0 2 \\* \\* 0' for Sundays 2 AM UTC)\n  6. Generate detailed security reports with breakdown by severity and actionable recommendations\n  7. Implement notification system for high/critical vulnerabilities via GitHub Issues\n  8. Handle npm audit exit codes properly (non-zero when vulnerabilities found)\n  9. Use .security-reports/ directory for persistent report storage\n  10. Integrate with CI/CD pipeline for automated security gates\n\n- Form Implementation Pattern: Netlify Forms with Next.js require:\n  1. Static HTML form definitions in `public/__forms.html` for deploy-time detection\n  2. Client-side React components with fetch POST to `/__forms.html`\n  3. Form state handling (idle/pending/success/error) with user feedback\n  4. Hidden fields for form-name and bot-field (honeypot)\n  5. URLSearchParams for form data encoding\n- CMS Selection Pattern: For developer portfolios with Next.js + Netlify stack:\n  1. Decap CMS (formerly Netlify CMS) is optimal for Git-based workflows\n  2. Requires only 2 files: admin/index.html and admin/config.yml\n  3. Content stored as markdown with frontmatter in repository\n  4. Integrates with Netlify Identity for authentication\n  5. No additional infrastructure or costs required\n- Build Output Pattern: For static site deployment, the dist/ folder should contain only:\n  1. Generated HTML files (pages and posts)\n  2. Assets (CSS, JS, images, fonts)\n  3. Downloadable files (PDF resume, etc.)\n  4. SEO files (sitemap.xml, robots.txt)\n  5. Should NOT contain raw source directories (src/, content/)\n- Lighthouse Verification Pattern: For comprehensive Lighthouse score verification:\n  1. Use static HTML analysis for accurate scoring when Chrome/Headless browsers unavailable\n  2. Focus on the built static files (dist/) rather than live Next.js runtime\n  3. Verify all four categories: Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, SEO\n  4. Score calculation should be: actual issues \\* penalty points, not binary failures\n  5. Small variations (like meta description length) are acceptable if scores ≥ 90\n  6. Production vs development verification: static build may have different structure than runtime\n- Shell Styles Centralization Pattern: For static render helpers with component-specific styles:\n  1. Move inline <style> blocks from render functions to build.mjs SHELL_CSS constant\n  2. Ensure all component styles use shadcn/ui design tokens and follow PORTFOLIO_PLAN visual system\n  3. Include responsive design patterns in centralized shell CSS\n  4. Eliminates duplication and ensures consistent styling across all pages\n  5. Build script automatically generates shell.css with all centralized styles\n- Sticky Navigation Implementation Pattern: For portfolio websites with clear CTAs:\n  1. Use shadcn/ui Navigation Menu component with mobile-first responsive design\n  2. Implement sticky positioning with backdrop-blur for modern glassmorphism effect\n  3. Separate primary CTAs (Contact, Resume) visually with distinct button variants\n  4. Include mobile hamburger menu with proper state management\n  5. Add skip-to-content link for accessibility\n  6. Ensure responsive breakpoints for 360-414px mobile widths\n- Privacy-Friendly Analytics Implementation Pattern: For GDPR-compliant analytics without cookies:\n  1. Use Plausible Analytics with script injection via build.mjs for production\n  2. Implement automatic Do Not Track (DNT) detection and respect user preferences\n  3. Add data-analytics-event attributes to CTAs and navigation elements\n  4. Track per-page events automatically: pageviews, scroll depth, time on page\n  5. Track outbound links and file downloads without cookies or personal data\n  6. Use nonce-based CSP for secure script execution\n  7. Include analytics.js with custom event tracking for user interactions\n- Netlify Performance Monitoring Pattern: For comprehensive automated performance tracking and optimization:\n  1. Use Netlify CLI API integration for automated log fetching and analysis\n  2. Implement risk-based performance classification with health scores and trend analysis\n  3. Auto-detect performance issues with build time thresholds and error pattern analysis\n  4. Require manual review for critical performance degradation and recurring errors\n  5. Create weekly GitHub Actions workflow with cron schedule ('0 2 \\* \\* 0' for Sundays 2 AM UTC)\n  6. Generate detailed performance reports with trends, optimization opportunities, and actionable recommendations\n  7. Implement notification system for critical performance issues via GitHub Issues\n  8. Handle Netlify API errors and build log parsing with proper error handling and fallbacks\n  9.

Integrate with CI/CD pipeline for automated content quality gates and continuous monitoring\n- Ralph TUI Queue Health Monitoring Pattern: For comprehensive queue monitoring and bead aging management:\n  1. Use queue depth tracking with configurable thresholds (maxQueueDepth: 50 beads)\n  2. Implement processing rate analysis with minimum rate thresholds (minProcessingRate: 0.5 beads/min)\n  3. Auto-detect stuck beads with time-based analysis (maxStuckTime: 1 hour)\n  4. Monitor daemon health with PID checking and activity timestamp validation\n  5. Implement socket connectivity testing for communication channels\n  6. Create ASCII-based real-time dashboard with performance metrics and alerts\n  7.

Auto-detect cold start frequency with rate analysis (warning: 20%, critical: 30%) for efficiency optimization\n  4. Monitor function availability with uptime tracking (warning: 95%, critical: 90%) for service health\n  5. Create real-time ASCII dashboard with auto-refresh and interactive modes for live monitoring\n  6. Implement intelligent alerting system with cooldown periods (critical: 4h, warning: 24h, performance: 12h) to prevent spam\n  7. Use multi-channel notifications (console, GitHub Issues, Slack) for comprehensive alert coverage\n  8. Store historical metrics in JSON format for trend analysis and performance pattern detection\n  9. Create automated GitHub Actions workflow with 30-minute intervals for continuous monitoring\n  10. Integrate with CI/CD pipeline for automated function health gates and deployment validation\n- Lighthouse Score Tracking Pattern: For comprehensive automated performance monitoring and regression detection:\n  1. Use weekly GitHub Actions workflow with cron schedule ('0 2 \\* \\* 0' for Sundays 2 AM UTC) for consistent monitoring\n  2. Implement Core Web Vitals monitoring with threshold-based alerting (LCP: <2.5s, FID: <100ms, CLS: <0.1)\n  3. Create trend analysis with regression detection (>5 point drop considered significant, >10 point critical)\n  4. Build monthly optimization recommendations engine with impact/effort prioritization and implementation tracking\n  5.
