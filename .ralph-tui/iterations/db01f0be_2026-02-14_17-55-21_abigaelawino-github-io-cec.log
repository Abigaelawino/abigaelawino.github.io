Agents update this file\n4: after each iteration and it's included in prompts for context.\n5: \n6: ## Codebase Patterns (Study These First)\n7: \n8: - Dependency Security Scanning Pattern: For automated vulnerability management in npm projects:\n9:   1. Use npm audit --json for comprehensive vulnerability detection\n10:   2. Implement risk-based classification (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH) with different handling strategies\n11:   3. Auto-patch low-risk vulnerabilities in safe packages (@types/_, eslint-_, prettier, jest, etc.)\n12:   4. Require manual review for critical packages (next, react, react-dom, express, jsonwebtoken, etc.)\n13:   5. Create weekly GitHub Actions workflow with cron schedule ('0 2 \\* \\* 0' for Sundays 2 AM UTC)\n14:   6. Generate detailed security reports with breakdown by severity and actionable recommendations\n15:   7. Implement notification system for high/critical vulnerabilities via GitHub Issues\n16:   8. Handle npm audit exit codes properly (non-zero when vulnerabilities found)\n17:   9. Use .security-reports/ directory for persistent report storage\n18:   10. Integrate with CI/CD pipeline for automated security gates\n19: \n20: - Form Implementation Pattern: Netlify Forms with Next.js require:\n21:   1. Static HTML form definitions in `public/__forms.html` for deploy-time detection\n22:   2. Client-side React components with fetch POST to `/__forms.html`\n23:   3. Form state handling (idle/pending/success/error) with user feedback\n24:   4. Hidden fields for form-name and bot-field (honeypot)\n25:   5. URLSearchParams for form data encoding\n26: - CMS Selection Pattern: For developer portfolios with Next.js + Netlify stack:\n27:   1. Decap CMS (formerly Netlify CMS) is optimal for Git-based workflows\n28:   2. Requires only 2 files: admin/index.html and admin/config.yml\n29:   3. Content stored as markdown with frontmatter in repository\n30:   4. Integrates with Netlify Identity for authentication\n31:   5. No additional infrastructure or costs required\n32: - Build Output Pattern: For static site deployment, the dist/ folder should contain only:\n33:   1. Generated HTML files (pages and posts)\n34:   2. Assets (CSS, JS, images, fonts)\n35:   3. Downloadable files (PDF resume, etc.)\n36:   4. SEO files (sitemap.xml, robots.txt)\n37:   5. Should NOT contain raw source directories (src/, content/)\n38: - Lighthouse Verification Pattern: For comprehensive Lighthouse score verification:\n39:   1. Use static HTML analysis for accurate scoring when Chrome/Headless browsers unavailable\n40:   2. Focus on the built static files (dist/) rather than live Next.js runtime\n41:   3. Verify all four categories: Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, SEO\n42:   4. Score calculation should be: actual issues \\* penalty points, not binary failures\n43:   5. Small variations (like meta description length) are acceptable if scores ≥ 90\n44:   6. Production vs development verification: static build may have different structure than runtime\n45: - Shell Styles Centralization Pattern: For static render helpers with component-specific styles:\n46:   1. Move inline <style> blocks from render functions to build.mjs SHELL_CSS constant\n47:   2. Ensure all component styles use shadcn/ui design tokens and follow PORTFOLIO_PLAN visual system\n48:   3. Include responsive design patterns in centralized shell CSS\n49:   4. Eliminates duplication and ensures consistent styling across all pages\n50:   5. Build script automatically generates shell.css with all centralized styles\n51: - Sticky Navigation Implementation Pattern: For portfolio websites with clear CTAs:\n52:   1. Use shadcn/ui Navigation Menu component with mobile-first responsive design\n53:   2. Implement sticky positioning with backdrop-blur for modern glassmorphism effect\n54:   3. Separate primary CTAs (Contact, Resume) visually with distinct button variants\n55:   4. Include mobile hamburger menu with proper state management\n56:   5. Add skip-to-content link for accessibility\n57:   6. Ensure responsive breakpoints for 360-414px mobile widths\n58: - Privacy-Friendly Analytics Implementation Pattern: For GDPR-compliant analytics without cookies:\n59:   1. Use Plausible Analytics with script injection via build.mjs for production\n60:   2. Implement automatic Do Not Track (DNT) detection and respect user preferences\n61:   3. Add data-analytics-event attributes to CTAs and navigation elements\n62:   4. Track per-page events automatically: pageviews, scroll depth, time on page\n63:   5. Track outbound links and file downloads without cookies or personal data\n64:   6. Use nonce-based CSP for secure script execution\n65:   7. Include analytics.js with custom event tracking for user interactions\n66: - Netlify Performance Monitoring Pattern: For comprehensive automated performance tracking and optimization:\n67:   1. Use Netlify CLI API integration for automated log fetching and analysis\n68:   2. Implement risk-based performance classification with health scores and trend analysis\n69:   3. Auto-detect performance issues with build time thresholds and error pattern analysis\n70:   4. Require manual review for critical performance degradation and recurring errors\n71:   5. Create weekly GitHub Actions workflow with cron schedule ('0 2 \\* \\* 0' for Sundays 2 AM UTC)\n72:   6. Generate detailed performance reports with trends, optimization opportunities, and actionable recommendations\n73:   7. Implement notification system for critical performance issues via GitHub Issues\n74:   8. Handle Netlify API errors and build log parsing with proper error handling and fallbacks\n75:   9. Use .netlify-reports/ directory for persistent report storage and dashboard generation\n76:   10. Integrate with CI/CD pipeline for automated performance gates and continuous monitoring\n77: - Content Freshness Monitoring Pattern: For automated content quality management and maintenance:\n78:   1. Implement content age analysis with different thresholds by content type (blog/projects/certifications)\n79:   2. Use risk-based content classification (FRESH/AGING/STALE/EXPIRED) with priority-based handling\n80:   3. Detect temporal keywords and time-sensitive language requiring priority updates\n81:   4. Generate specific, actionable recommendations with update templates and bulk operations\n82:   5. Create monthly trend analysis with historical tracking and strategic insights\n83:   6. Implement quarterly maintenance scheduling with goals and monthly breakdowns\n84:   7. Use content health scoring system with visual badges and comprehensive validation\n85:   8. Create automated GitHub Actions workflow with monthly triggers and manual dispatch options\n86:   9. Generate multiple report formats (JSON/Markdown) for different use cases and stakeholders\n87:   10. Integrate with CI/CD pipeline for automated content quality gates and continuous monitoring\n88: - Ralph TUI Queue Health Monitoring Pattern: For comprehensive queue monitoring and bead aging management:\n89:   1. Use queue depth tracking with configurable thresholds (maxQueueDepth: 50 beads)\n90:   2. Implement processing rate analysis with minimum rate thresholds (minProcessingRate: 0.5 beads/min)\n91:   3. Auto-detect stuck beads with time-based analysis (maxStuckTime: 1 hour)\n92:   4. Monitor daemon health with PID checking and activity timestamp validation\n93:   5. Implement socket connectivity testing for communication channels\n94:   6. Create ASCII-based real-time dashboard with performance metrics and alerts\n95:   7. Use bead aging categorization (Fresh: 1d, Aging: 3d, Stale: 7d, Critical: 14d)\n96:   8. Generate trend analysis with processing rates and queue depth patterns\n97:   9. Implement intelligent alerting with cooldown periods to prevent spam\n98:   10. Create automated GitHub Actions workflow with 30-minute intervals and issue creation\n99: \n100: ---\n101: \n102: ## [2026-02-14] - abigaelawino-github-io-429\n103: \n104: - Implemented comprehensive MCP server health monitoring system for Ralph TUI\n105: -

Added quick reference commands and configuration file monitoring\n158: - Files changed:\n159:   - docs/netlify-build-deploy-checklist.md (new)\n160: - **Learnings:**\n161:   - Patterns discovered: The project uses a hybrid static + Next.js approach with dist/ for static assets and .next/ for functions\n162:   - Gotchas encountered: Build process involves two stages - static generation (scripts/build.mjs) and Next.js compilation (next build)\n163:   - Netlify configuration already comprehensive with proper headers, redirects, and function mappings\n164:   - The deploy script in package.json already uses the correct --dir=dist flag for static deployment\n165:   - Environment validation script already exists and should be used before builds\n166:   - Comprehensive testing infrastructure already in place with smoke tests for both local and production\n167:   - All necessary Netlify functions are implemented including webhooks, session management, and deployment monitoring\n168: \n169: ---\n170: \n171: ## [2025-02-14] - abigaelawino-github-io-6p7\n172: \n173: - Updated scripts/build.mjs to streamline build output to only generated assets\n174: - Removed unnecessary copying of src/ and content/ folders to dist/\n175: - dist/ now contains only: generated HTML files, resume PDF, shared CSS/JS, and necessary assets\n176: - Files changed:\n177:   - scripts/build.mjs (updated)\n178: - **Learnings:**\n179:   - Patterns discovered: The build script was copying raw source directories unnecessarily\n180:   - Gotchas encountered: Need to ensure only generated assets are in dist/ for deployment\n181:   - The dist folder should match PORTFOLIO_PLAN publish expectations - minimal production-ready output\n182: \n183: ---\n184: \n185: ## [2025-02-14] - abigaelawino-github-io-6n3\n186: \n187: - Updated package.json dev script to run scripts/dev.mjs instead of netlify dev\n188: - Exposed npm run dev entry that boots the renderer script in watch mode\n189: - Verified the dev script works correctly with automatic rebuilds on file changes\n190: - Files changed:\n191:   - package.json (updated dev script)\n192: - **Learnings:**\n193:   - Patterns discovered: The dev.mjs script already implemented watch mode using chokidar\n194:   - Gotchas encountered: The original package.json had dev script pointing to netlify dev instead of dev.mjs\n195:   - The dev.mjs script provides both build watching and dev server functionality in one command\n196:   - This enables the intended workflow where netlify dev and helper tmux sessions can run the portfolio locally\n197: \n198: ---\n199: \n200: ## [2025-02-14] - abigaelawino-github-io-59i\n201: \n202: - Verified Lighthouse scores >90 across all pages using comprehensive static analysis\n203: - Created multiple verification approaches: local Chrome, PageSpeed Insights API, and static HTML analysis\n204: -

Files changed:\n740:   - scripts/ralph-queue-monitor.mjs (new - core monitoring with daemon, queue, and socket health checks)\n741:   - scripts/ralph-queue-dashboard.mjs (new - real-time ASCII dashboard with metrics visualization)\n742:   - scripts/ralph-bead-aging.mjs (new - bead aging analysis and trend detection)\n743:   - .github/workflows/ralph-queue-monitoring.yml (new - automated monitoring workflow every 30 minutes)\n744:   - docs/ralph-queue-monitoring.md (new - comprehensive documentation and usage guide)\n745:   - package.json (updated with ralph monitoring scripts: ralph:monitor, ralph:dashboard, ralph:aging)\n746:   - .ralph-tui/progress.md (updated with Ralph TUI Queue Health Monitoring Pattern)\n747: - **Learnings:**\n748:   - Patterns discovered: Ralph TUI monitoring requires access to .beads/ directory and bd command for detailed bead information\n749:   - Gotchas encountered: bd command syntax differs from expected (bd list vs bd ls), monitoring needs fallback mechanisms when bd unavailable\n750:   - ASCII dashboards provide excellent visibility without external dependencies and work in any terminal environment\n751:   - Alert cooldown periods are essential to prevent notification spam while ensuring critical issues are surfaced\n752:   - Bead aging analysis requires different thresholds by priority and comprehensive categorization for actionable insights\n753:   - GitHub Actions workflow integration enables automated monitoring with artifact storage and issue creation for critical alerts\n754:   - Queue health monitoring benefits from multiple data sources: daemon status, socket connectivity, and bead processing metrics\n\n(Output truncated at 51200 bytes.

Use npm audit --json for comprehensive vulnerability detection\n  2. Implement risk-based classification (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH) with different handling strategies\n  3. Auto-patch low-risk vulnerabilities in safe packages (@types/_, eslint-_, prettier, jest, etc.)\n  4. Require manual review for critical packages (next, react, react-dom, express, jsonwebtoken, etc.)\n  5. Create weekly GitHub Actions workflow with cron schedule ('0 2 \\* \\* 0' for Sundays 2 AM UTC)\n  6. Generate detailed security reports with breakdown by severity and actionable recommendations\n  7. Implement notification system for high/critical vulnerabilities via GitHub Issues\n  8. Handle npm audit exit codes properly (non-zero when vulnerabilities found)\n  9. Use .security-reports/ directory for persistent report storage\n  10. Integrate with CI/CD pipeline for automated security gates\n\n- Form Implementation Pattern: Netlify Forms with Next.js require:","truncated":true,"loaded":[]},"time":{"start":1771109729409,"end":1771109729412}}}}

Agents update this file\nafter each iteration and it's included in prompts for context.\n\n## Codebase Patterns (Study These First)\n\n- Dependency Security Scanning Pattern: For automated vulnerability management in npm projects:\n  1. Use npm audit --json for comprehensive vulnerability detection\n  2. Implement risk-based classification (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH) with different handling strategies\n  3. Auto-patch low-risk vulnerabilities in safe packages (@types/_, eslint-_, prettier, jest, etc.)\n  4. Require manual review for critical packages (next, react, react-dom, express, jsonwebtoken, etc.)\n  5. Create weekly GitHub Actions workflow with cron schedule ('0 2 \\* \\* 0' for Sundays 2 AM UTC)\n  6. Generate detailed security reports with breakdown by severity and actionable recommendations\n  7. Implement notification system for high/critical vulnerabilities via GitHub Issues\n  8. Handle npm audit exit codes properly (non-zero when vulnerabilities found)\n  9. Use .security-reports/ directory for persistent report storage\n  10. Integrate with CI/CD pipeline for automated security gates\n\n- Form Implementation Pattern: Netlify Forms with Next.js require:\n  1. Static HTML form definitions in `public/__forms.html` for deploy-time detection\n  2. Client-side React components with fetch POST to `/__forms.html`\n  3. Form state handling (idle/pending/success/error) with user feedback\n  4. Hidden fields for form-name and bot-field (honeypot)\n  5. URLSearchParams for form data encoding\n- CMS Selection Pattern: For developer portfolios with Next.js + Netlify stack:\n  1. Decap CMS (formerly Netlify CMS) is optimal for Git-based workflows\n  2. Requires only 2 files: admin/index.html and admin/config.yml\n  3. Content stored as markdown with frontmatter in repository\n  4. Integrates with Netlify Identity for authentication\n  5. No additional infrastructure or costs required\n- Build Output Pattern: For static site deployment, the dist/ folder should contain only:\n  1. Generated HTML files (pages and posts)\n  2. Assets (CSS, JS, images, fonts)\n  3. Downloadable files (PDF resume, etc.)\n  4. SEO files (sitemap.xml, robots.txt)\n  5. Should NOT contain raw source directories (src/, content/)\n- Lighthouse Verification Pattern: For comprehensive Lighthouse score verification:\n  1. Use static HTML analysis for accurate scoring when Chrome/Headless browsers unavailable\n  2. Focus on the built static files (dist/) rather than live Next.js runtime\n  3. Verify all four categories: Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, SEO\n  4. Score calculation should be: actual issues \\* penalty points, not binary failures\n  5. Small variations (like meta description length) are acceptable if scores ≥ 90\n  6. Production vs development verification: static build may have different structure than runtime\n- Shell Styles Centralization Pattern: For static render helpers with component-specific styles:\n  1. Move inline <style> blocks from render functions to build.mjs SHELL_CSS constant\n  2. Ensure all component styles use shadcn/ui design tokens and follow PORTFOLIO_PLAN visual system\n  3. Include responsive design patterns in centralized shell CSS\n  4. Eliminates duplication and ensures consistent styling across all pages\n  5. Build script automatically generates shell.css with all centralized styles\n- Sticky Navigation Implementation Pattern: For portfolio websites with clear CTAs:\n  1. Use shadcn/ui Navigation Menu component with mobile-first responsive design\n  2. Implement sticky positioning with backdrop-blur for modern glassmorphism effect\n  3. Separate primary CTAs (Contact, Resume) visually with distinct button variants\n  4. Include mobile hamburger menu with proper state management\n  5. Add skip-to-content link for accessibility\n  6. Ensure responsive breakpoints for 360-414px mobile widths\n- Privacy-Friendly Analytics Implementation Pattern: For GDPR-compliant analytics without cookies:\n  1. Use Plausible Analytics with script injection via build.mjs for production\n  2. Implement automatic Do Not Track (DNT) detection and respect user preferences\n  3. Add data-analytics-event attributes to CTAs and navigation elements\n  4. Track per-page events automatically: pageviews, scroll depth, time on page\n  5. Track outbound links and file downloads without cookies or personal data\n  6. Use nonce-based CSP for secure script execution\n  7. Include analytics.js with custom event tracking for user interactions\n- Netlify Performance Monitoring Pattern: For comprehensive automated performance tracking and optimization:\n  1. Use Netlify CLI API integration for automated log fetching and analysis\n  2. Implement risk-based performance classification with health scores and trend analysis\n  3. Auto-detect performance issues with build time thresholds and error pattern analysis\n  4. Require manual review for critical performance degradation and recurring errors\n  5. Create weekly GitHub Actions workflow with cron schedule ('0 2 \\* \\* 0' for Sundays 2 AM UTC)\n  6. Generate detailed performance reports with trends, optimization opportunities, and actionable recommendations\n  7. Implement notification system for critical performance issues via GitHub Issues\n  8. Handle Netlify API errors and build log parsing with proper error handling and fallbacks\n  9. Use .netlify-reports/ directory for persistent report storage and dashboard generation\n  10. Integrate with CI/CD pipeline for automated performance gates and continuous monitoring\n- Content Freshness Monitoring Pattern: For automated content quality management and maintenance:\n  1. Implement content age analysis with different thresholds by content type (blog/projects/certifications)\n  2. Use risk-based content classification (FRESH/AGING/STALE/EXPIRED) with priority-based handling\n  3. Detect temporal keywords and time-sensitive language requiring priority updates\n  4. Generate specific, actionable recommendations with update templates and bulk operations\n  5. Create monthly trend analysis with historical tracking and strategic insights\n  6. Implement quarterly maintenance scheduling with goals and monthly breakdowns\n  7. Use content health scoring system with visual badges and comprehensive validation\n  8. Create automated GitHub Actions workflow with monthly triggers and manual dispatch options\n  9. Generate multiple report formats (JSON/Markdown) for different use cases and stakeholders\n  10. Integrate with CI/CD pipeline for automated content quality gates and continuous monitoring\n- Ralph TUI Queue Health Monitoring Pattern: For comprehensive queue monitoring and bead aging management:\n  1. Use queue depth tracking with configurable thresholds (maxQueueDepth: 50 beads)\n  2. Implement processing rate analysis with minimum rate thresholds (minProcessingRate: 0.5 beads/min)\n  3. Auto-detect stuck beads with time-based analysis (maxStuckTime: 1 hour)\n  4. Monitor daemon health with PID checking and activity timestamp validation\n  5. Implement socket connectivity testing for communication channels\n  6. Create ASCII-based real-time dashboard with performance metrics and alerts\n  7. Use bead aging categorization (Fresh: 1d, Aging: 3d, Stale: 7d, Critical: 14d)\n  8. Generate trend analysis with processing rates and queue depth patterns\n  9. Implement intelligent alerting with cooldown periods to prevent spam\n  10. Create automated GitHub Actions workflow with 30-minute intervals and issue creation\n\n---\n\n## [2026-02-14] - abigaelawino-github-io-429\n\n- Implemented comprehensive MCP server health monitoring system for Ralph TUI\n- Created monitoring script with health checks, response time tracking, and error rate monitoring\n- Added real-time ASCII dashboard displaying server status, alerts, and performance metrics\n- Set up automated alerts for server downtime and performance degradation with cooldown periods\n- Implemented GitHub Actions workflow for continuous monitoring every 5 minutes with issue creation\n- Added comprehensive test suite covering all monitoring components and failure scenarios\n- Created detailed documentation with configuration, usage, and troubleshooting guides\n- Files changed:\n  -

test/mcp-monitoring.test.js (new - comprehensive test suite)\n  - docs/mcp-monitoring.md (new - detailed documentation)\n  - package.json (updated with mcp-monitor and mcp-dashboard scripts)\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Patterns discovered: MCP server monitoring requires command execution with timeout handling and error categorization\n  - Gotchas encountered: GitHub Actions YAML requires strict indentation and no trailing whitespace, variable declarations in switch statements need block scoping\n  - ASCII dashboards provide excellent visibility without requiring external dependencies\n  - Alert cooldown periods prevent notification spam while ensuring critical issues are surfaced\n  - Comprehensive test coverage is essential for monitoring systems to handle edge cases\n  - Monitoring data storage in JSON format provides easy integration with other tools\n  - GitHub Actions issue creation enables automated incident management for critical alerts\n  - Response time thresholds should be configured per server based on expected performance characteristics\n\n---\n\n## [2026-02-14] - abigaelawino-github-io-bnz\n\n- Implemented comprehensive automated dependency security scanning system\n- Enhanced existing security scanner with improved error handling for npm audit exit codes\n- Fixed security notifier to use proper ES module imports instead of require()\n- Created detailed documentation for the security scanning system\n- Verified all components work correctly: scanner, notifier, and GitHub workflow\n- Files changed:\n  -

.ralph-tui/progress.md (updated with Dependency Security Scanning Pattern)\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Patterns discovered: npm audit exits with non-zero code when vulnerabilities are found, requiring special error handling\n  - Gotchas encountered: ES modules can't use require() syntax, must use proper import statements\n  - The existing GitHub workflow was already comprehensive but the underlying scripts needed fixes\n  - Auto-patching indirect dependencies requires npm audit fix, not individual package updates\n  - Security scanning should be risk-based with different handling for low vs high severity vulnerabilities\n  - GitHub Actions provide excellent automation for weekly security scans with issue creation and PR comments\n\n---\n\n## [2025-02-14] - abigaelawino-github-io-ves\n\n- Created comprehensive Netlify build/deploy checklist covering all steps for building, testing, and deploying via Netlify CLI\n- Documented prerequisites, build process, deployment steps, post-deploy monitoring, and troubleshooting\n- Included verification steps for shadcn/ui components, API endpoints, and static assets\n- Added quick reference commands and configuration file monitoring\n- Files changed:\n  - docs/netlify-build-deploy-checklist.md (new)\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Patterns discovered: The project uses a hybrid static + Next.js approach with dist/ for static assets and .next/ for functions\n  - Gotchas encountered: Build process involves two stages - static generation (scripts/build.mjs) and Next.js compilation (next build)\n  - Netlify configuration already comprehensive with proper headers, redirects, and function mappings\n  - The deploy script in package.json already uses the correct --dir=dist flag for static deployment\n  - Environment validation script already exists and should be used before builds\n  - Comprehensive testing infrastructure already in place with smoke tests for both local and production\n  - All necessary Netlify functions are implemented including webhooks, session management, and deployment monitoring\n\n---\n\n## [2025-02-14] - abigaelawino-github-io-6p7\n\n- Updated scripts/build.mjs to streamline build output to only generated assets\n- Removed unnecessary copying of src/ and content/ folders to dist/\n- dist/ now contains only: generated HTML files, resume PDF, shared CSS/JS, and necessary assets\n- Files changed:\n  - scripts/build.mjs (updated)\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Patterns discovered: The build script was copying raw source directories unnecessarily\n  - Gotchas encountered: Need to ensure only generated assets are in dist/ for deployment\n  - The dist folder should match PORTFOLIO_PLAN publish expectations - minimal production-ready output\n\n---\n\n## [2025-02-14] - abigaelawino-github-io-6n3\n\n- Updated package.json dev script to run scripts/dev.mjs instead of netlify dev\n- Exposed npm run dev entry that boots the renderer script in watch mode\n- Verified the dev script works correctly with automatic rebuilds on file changes\n- Files changed:\n  - package.json (updated dev script)\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Patterns discovered: The dev.mjs script already implemented watch mode using chokidar\n  - Gotchas encountered: The original package.json had dev script pointing to netlify dev instead of dev.mjs\n  - The dev.mjs script provides both build watching and dev server functionality in one command\n  - This enables the intended workflow where netlify dev and helper tmux sessions can run the portfolio locally\n\n---\n\n## [2025-02-14] - abigaelawino-github-io-59i\n\n- Verified Lighthouse scores >90 across all pages using comprehensive static analysis\n- Created multiple verification approaches: local Chrome, PageSpeed Insights API, and static HTML analysis\n- Confirmed all 6 pages (home, about, projects, blog, contact, resume) achieve scores ≥ 90\n- Static build analysis showed: Performance: 100, Accessibility: 100, Best Practices: 100, SEO: 97 average\n- Only minor issue: meta descriptions slightly under 120 characters (SEO score still 97)\n- Files changed:\n  - scripts/lighthouse-audit.js (existing - unused)\n  - scripts/run-lighthouse.sh (existing - unused)\n  - scripts/analyze-lighthouse.js (removed - had linting issues)\n  - scripts/validate-env.mjs (fixed linting issues)\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Patterns discovered: Static HTML analysis is more reliable than Chrome-based tools when browser unavailable\n  - Gotchas encountered: Production Next.js site has different structure than static build files\n  - Lighthouse scoring should use penalty-based calculation, not binary pass/fail for minor issues\n  - Meta description length recommendations (120-160 chars) are guidelines, not strict requirements\n  - The static build contains all required SEO elements: proper titles, descriptions, Open Graph tags, etc.\n  - Chrome/Headless browser availability varies by environment; static analysis provides consistent results\n  - PageSpeed Insights API has strict quotas; alternative verification methods needed for continuous use\n\n---\n\n## [2025-02-14] - abigaelawino-github-io-3su.19\n\n- Created 8 follow-up monitoring and automation beads for ongoing Ralph queue health\n- Established comprehensive monitoring strategy covering MCP servers, Netlify functions, Lighthouse scores, dependency security, and content freshness\n- Files changed: None (beads created in database)\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Patterns discovered: Ralph queue requires continuous feeding with operational tasks to prevent starvation\n  - Gotchas encountered: Bead creation uses simple flags, not complex parameter structures\n  - Ongoing monitoring needs to be proactive rather than reactive to maintain system health\n  - Portfolio sites require both technical monitoring and content freshness tracking\n  - Automation is key for sustainable long-term maintenance of static sites\n\n---\n\n## [2026-02-14] - abigaelawino-forms-2\n\n- Implemented comprehensive spam protection for inquiry forms with multiple layers of security\n- Enhanced both contact and newsletter forms with client-side validation, rate limiting, and bot detection\n- Created shared form validation utilities for consistency and maintainability\n- Added server-side validation and rate limiting via Netlify Functions\n- Implemented optional reCAPTCHA v3 integration edge function\n- Created comprehensive test coverage for all validation logic\n- Files changed:\n  - components/contact-form.tsx (enhanced with validation and rate limiting)\n  - components/newsletter-form.tsx (enhanced with validation and rate limiting)\n  - netlify/functions/rate-limiter.js (updated with form-specific limits)\n  - netlify/functions/form-validator.js (new - server-side validation)\n  - netlify/edge-functions/recaptcha-validation.js (new - optional reCAPTCHA)\n  - lib/form-validation.ts (new - shared validation utilities)\n  - lib/form-validation.js (new - CommonJS version for tests)\n  - test/lib/form-validation.test.js (new - comprehensive tests)\n  - test/forms-e2e.test.js (new - form integration tests)\n  - docs/FORM_SPAM_PROTECTION.md (new - documentation)\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Patterns discovered: Spam protection requires multiple layers working together (honeypot, validation, rate limiting, timing)\n  - Gotchas encountered: TypeScript modules can't be directly imported in Node.js test runner - needed CommonJS version\n  - Rate limiting should be form-type specific with different windows and limits per form\n  - Client-side validation provides immediate feedback but server-side is essential for security\n  -

Use npm audit --json for comprehensive vulnerability detection\n  2. Implement risk-based classification (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH) with different handling strategies\n  3. Auto-patch low-risk vulnerabilities in safe packages (@types/_, eslint-_, prettier, jest, etc.)\n  4. Require manual review for critical packages (next, react, react-dom, express, jsonwebtoken, etc.)\n  5. Create weekly GitHub Actions workflow with cron schedule ('0 2 \\* \\* 0' for Sundays 2 AM UTC)\n  6. Generate detailed security reports with breakdown by severity and actionable recommendations\n  7. Implement notification system for high/critical vulnerabilities via GitHub Issues\n  8. Handle npm audit exit codes properly (non-zero when vulnerabilities found)\n  9. Use .security-reports/ directory for persistent report storage\n  10. Integrate with CI/CD pipeline for automated security gates\n\n- Form Implementation Pattern: Netlify Forms with Next.js require:\n  1. Static HTML form definitions in `public/__forms.html` for deploy-time detection\n  2. Client-side React components with fetch POST to `/__forms.html`\n  3. Form state handling (idle/pending/success/error) with user feedback\n  4. Hidden fields for form-name and bot-field (honeypot)\n  5. URLSearchParams for form data encoding\n- CMS Selection Pattern: For developer portfolios with Next.js + Netlify stack:\n  1. Decap CMS (formerly Netlify CMS) is optimal for Git-based workflows\n  2. Requires only 2 files: admin/index.html and admin/config.yml\n  3. Content stored as markdown with frontmatter in repository\n  4. Integrates with Netlify Identity for authentication\n  5. No additional infrastructure or costs required\n- Build Output Pattern: For static site deployment, the dist/ folder should contain only:\n  1. Generated HTML files (pages and posts)\n  2. Assets (CSS, JS, images, fonts)\n  3. Downloadable files (PDF resume, etc.)\n  4. SEO files (sitemap.xml, robots.txt)\n  5. Should NOT contain raw source directories (src/, content/)\n- Lighthouse Verification Pattern: For comprehensive Lighthouse score verification:\n  1. Use static HTML analysis for accurate scoring when Chrome/Headless browsers unavailable\n  2. Focus on the built static files (dist/) rather than live Next.js runtime\n  3. Verify all four categories: Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, SEO\n  4. Score calculation should be: actual issues \\* penalty points, not binary failures\n  5. Small variations (like meta description length) are acceptable if scores ≥ 90\n  6. Production vs development verification: static build may have different structure than runtime\n- Shell Styles Centralization Pattern: For static render helpers with component-specific styles:\n  1. Move inline <style> blocks from render functions to build.mjs SHELL_CSS constant\n  2. Ensure all component styles use shadcn/ui design tokens and follow PORTFOLIO_PLAN visual system\n  3. Include responsive design patterns in centralized shell CSS\n  4. Eliminates duplication and ensures consistent styling across all pages\n  5. Build script automatically generates shell.css with all centralized styles\n- Sticky Navigation Implementation Pattern: For portfolio websites with clear CTAs:\n  1. Use shadcn/ui Navigation Menu component with mobile-first responsive design\n  2. Implement sticky positioning with backdrop-blur for modern glassmorphism effect\n  3. Separate primary CTAs (Contact, Resume) visually with distinct button variants\n  4. Include mobile hamburger menu with proper state management\n  5. Add skip-to-content link for accessibility\n  6. Ensure responsive breakpoints for 360-414px mobile widths\n- Privacy-Friendly Analytics Implementation Pattern: For GDPR-compliant analytics without cookies:\n  1. Use Plausible Analytics with script injection via build.mjs for production\n  2. Implement automatic Do Not Track (DNT) detection and respect user preferences\n  3. Add data-analytics-event attributes to CTAs and navigation elements\n  4. Track per-page events automatically: pageviews, scroll depth, time on page\n  5. Track outbound links and file downloads without cookies or personal data\n  6. Use nonce-based CSP for secure script execution\n  7. Include analytics.js with custom event tracking for user interactions\n- Netlify Performance Monitoring Pattern: For comprehensive automated performance tracking and optimization:\n  1. Use Netlify CLI API integration for automated log fetching and analysis\n  2. Implement risk-based performance classification with health scores and trend analysis\n  3. Auto-detect performance issues with build time thresholds and error pattern analysis\n  4. Require manual review for critical performance degradation and recurring errors\n  5. Create weekly GitHub Actions workflow with cron schedule ('0 2 \\* \\* 0' for Sundays 2 AM UTC)\n  6. Generate detailed performance reports with trends, optimization opportunities, and actionable recommendations\n  7. Implement notification system for critical performance issues via GitHub Issues\n  8. Handle Netlify API errors and build log parsing with proper error handling and fallbacks\n  9. Use .netlify-reports/ directory for persistent report storage and dashboard generation\n  10. Integrate with CI/CD pipeline for automated performance gates and continuous monitoring\n- Content Freshness Monitoring Pattern: For automated content quality management and maintenance:\n  1. Implement content age analysis with different thresholds by content type (blog/projects/certifications)\n  2. Use risk-based content classification (FRESH/AGING/STALE/EXPIRED) with priority-based handling\n  3. Detect temporal keywords and time-sensitive language requiring priority updates\n  4. Generate specific, actionable recommendations with update templates and bulk operations\n  5. Create monthly trend analysis with historical tracking and strategic insights\n  6. Implement quarterly maintenance scheduling with goals and monthly breakdowns\n  7. Use content health scoring system with visual badges and comprehensive validation\n  8. Create automated GitHub Actions workflow with monthly triggers and manual dispatch options\n  9. Generate multiple report formats (JSON/Markdown) for different use cases and stakeholders\n  10. Integrate with CI/CD pipeline for automated content quality gates and continuous monitoring\n- Ralph TUI Queue Health Monitoring Pattern: For comprehensive queue monitoring and bead aging management:\n  1. Use queue depth tracking with configurable thresholds (maxQueueDepth: 50 beads)\n  2. Implement processing rate analysis with minimum rate thresholds (minProcessingRate: 0.5 beads/min)\n  3. Auto-detect stuck beads with time-based analysis (maxStuckTime: 1 hour)\n  4. Monitor daemon health with PID checking and activity timestamp validation\n  5. Implement socket connectivity testing for communication channels\n  6. Create ASCII-based real-time dashboard with performance metrics and alerts\n  7. Use bead aging categorization (Fresh: 1d, Aging: 3d, Stale: 7d, Critical: 14d)\n  8. Generate trend analysis with processing rates and queue depth patterns\n  9. Implement intelligent alerting with cooldown periods to prevent spam\n  10. Create automated GitHub Actions workflow with 30-minute intervals and issue creation\n\n---\n\n## [2026-02-14] - abigaelawino-github-io-429\n\n- Implemented comprehensive MCP server health monitoring system for Ralph TUI\n- Created monitoring script with health checks, response time tracking, and error rate monitoring\n- Added real-time ASCII dashboard displaying server status, alerts, and performance metrics\n- Set up automated alerts for server downtime and performance degradation with cooldown periods\n- Implemented GitHub Actions workflow for continuous monitoring every 5 minutes with issue creation\n- Added comprehensive test suite covering all monitoring components and failure scenarios\n- Created detailed documentation with configuration, usage, and troubleshooting guides\n- Files changed:\n  -

Agents update this file\nafter each iteration and it's included in prompts for context.\n\n## Codebase Patterns (Study These First)\n\n- Dependency Security Scanning Pattern: For automated vulnerability management in npm projects:\n  1. Use npm audit --json for comprehensive vulnerability detection\n  2. Implement risk-based classification (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH) with different handling strategies\n  3. Auto-patch low-risk vulnerabilities in safe packages (@types/_, eslint-_, prettier, jest, etc.)\n  4. Require manual review for critical packages (next, react, react-dom, express, jsonwebtoken, etc.)\n  5. Create weekly GitHub Actions workflow with cron schedule ('0 2 \\* \\* 0' for Sundays 2 AM UTC)\n  6. Generate detailed security reports with breakdown by severity and actionable recommendations\n  7. Implement notification system for high/critical vulnerabilities via GitHub Issues\n  8. Handle npm audit exit codes properly (non-zero when vulnerabilities found)\n  9. Use .security-reports/ directory for persistent report storage\n  10. Integrate with CI/CD pipeline for automated security gates\n\n- Form Implementation Pattern: Netlify Forms with Next.js require:\n  1. Static HTML form definitions in `public/__forms.html` for deploy-time detection\n  2. Client-side React components with fetch POST to `/__forms.html`\n  3. Form state handling (idle/pending/success/error) with user feedback\n  4. Hidden fields for form-name and bot-field (honeypot)\n  5. URLSearchParams for form data encoding\n- CMS Selection Pattern: For developer portfolios with Next.js + Netlify stack:\n  1. Decap CMS (formerly Netlify CMS) is optimal for Git-based workflows\n  2. Requires only 2 files: admin/index.html and admin/config.yml\n  3. Content stored as markdown with frontmatter in repository\n  4. Integrates with Netlify Identity for authentication\n  5. No additional infrastructure or costs required\n- Build Output Pattern: For static site deployment, the dist/ folder should contain only:\n  1. Generated HTML files (pages and posts)\n  2. Assets (CSS, JS, images, fonts)\n  3. Downloadable files (PDF resume, etc.)\n  4. SEO files (sitemap.xml, robots.txt)\n  5. Should NOT contain raw source directories (src/, content/)\n- Lighthouse Verification Pattern: For comprehensive Lighthouse score verification:\n  1. Use static HTML analysis for accurate scoring when Chrome/Headless browsers unavailable\n  2. Focus on the built static files (dist/) rather than live Next.js runtime\n  3. Verify all four categories: Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, SEO\n  4. Score calculation should be: actual issues \\* penalty points, not binary failures\n  5. Small variations (like meta description length) are acceptable if scores ≥ 90\n  6. Production vs development verification: static build may have different structure than runtime\n- Shell Styles Centralization Pattern: For static render helpers with component-specific styles:\n  1. Move inline <style> blocks from render functions to build.mjs SHELL_CSS constant\n  2. Ensure all component styles use shadcn/ui design tokens and follow PORTFOLIO_PLAN visual system\n  3. Include responsive design patterns in centralized shell CSS\n  4. Eliminates duplication and ensures consistent styling across all pages\n  5. Build script automatically generates shell.css with all centralized styles\n- Sticky Navigation Implementation Pattern: For portfolio websites with clear CTAs:\n  1. Use shadcn/ui Navigation Menu component with mobile-first responsive design\n  2. Implement sticky positioning with backdrop-blur for modern glassmorphism effect\n  3. Separate primary CTAs (Contact, Resume) visually with distinct button variants\n  4. Include mobile hamburger menu with proper state management\n  5. Add skip-to-content link for accessibility\n  6. Ensure responsive breakpoints for 360-414px mobile widths\n- Privacy-Friendly Analytics Implementation Pattern: For GDPR-compliant analytics without cookies:\n  1. Use Plausible Analytics with script injection via build.mjs for production\n  2. Implement automatic Do Not Track (DNT) detection and respect user preferences\n  3. Add data-analytics-event attributes to CTAs and navigation elements\n  4. Track per-page events automatically: pageviews, scroll depth, time on page\n  5. Track outbound links and file downloads without cookies or personal data\n  6. Use nonce-based CSP for secure script execution\n  7. Include analytics.js with custom event tracking for user interactions\n- Netlify Performance Monitoring Pattern: For comprehensive automated performance tracking and optimization:\n  1. Use Netlify CLI API integration for automated log fetching and analysis\n  2. Implement risk-based performance classification with health scores and trend analysis\n  3. Auto-detect performance issues with build time thresholds and error pattern analysis\n  4. Require manual review for critical performance degradation and recurring errors\n  5. Create weekly GitHub Actions workflow with cron schedule ('0 2 \\* \\* 0' for Sundays 2 AM UTC)\n  6. Generate detailed performance reports with trends, optimization opportunities, and actionable recommendations\n  7. Implement notification system for critical performance issues via GitHub Issues\n  8. Handle Netlify API errors and build log parsing with proper error handling and fallbacks\n  9. Use .netlify-reports/ directory for persistent report storage and dashboard generation\n  10. Integrate with CI/CD pipeline for automated performance gates and continuous monitoring\n- Content Freshness Monitoring Pattern: For automated content quality management and maintenance:\n  1. Implement content age analysis with different thresholds by content type (blog/projects/certifications)\n  2. Use risk-based content classification (FRESH/AGING/STALE/EXPIRED) with priority-based handling\n  3. Detect temporal keywords and time-sensitive language requiring priority updates\n  4. Generate specific, actionable recommendations with update templates and bulk operations\n  5. Create monthly trend analysis with historical tracking and strategic insights\n  6. Implement quarterly maintenance scheduling with goals and monthly breakdowns\n  7. Use content health scoring system with visual badges and comprehensive validation\n  8. Create automated GitHub Actions workflow with monthly triggers and manual dispatch options\n  9. Generate multiple report formats (JSON/Markdown) for different use cases and stakeholders\n  10. Integrate with CI/CD pipeline for automated content quality gates and continuous monitoring\n- Ralph TUI Queue Health Monitoring Pattern: For comprehensive queue monitoring and bead aging management:\n  1. Use queue depth tracking with configurable thresholds (maxQueueDepth: 50 beads)\n  2. Implement processing rate analysis with minimum rate thresholds (minProcessingRate: 0.5 beads/min)\n  3. Auto-detect stuck beads with time-based analysis (maxStuckTime: 1 hour)\n  4. Monitor daemon health with PID checking and activity timestamp validation\n  5. Implement socket connectivity testing for communication channels\n  6. Create ASCII-based real-time dashboard with performance metrics and alerts\n  7. Use bead aging categorization (Fresh: 1d, Aging: 3d, Stale: 7d, Critical: 14d)\n  8. Generate trend analysis with processing rates and queue depth patterns\n  9. Implement intelligent alerting with cooldown periods to prevent spam\n  10. Create automated GitHub Actions workflow with 30-minute intervals and issue creation\n\n---\n\n## [2026-02-14] - abigaelawino-github-io-429\n\n- Implemented comprehensive MCP server health monitoring system for Ralph TUI\n- Created monitoring script with health checks, response time tracking, and error rate monitoring\n- Added real-time ASCII dashboard displaying server status, alerts, and performance metrics\n- Set up automated alerts for server downtime and performance degradation with cooldown periods\n- Implemented GitHub Actions workflow for continuous monitoring every 5 minutes with issue creation\n- Added comprehensive test suite covering all monitoring components and failure scenarios\n- Created detailed documentation with configuration, usage, and troubleshooting guides\n- Files changed:\n  -

Gotchas encountered: Build process involves two stages - static generation (scripts/build.mjs) and Next.js compilation (next build)\n  - Netlify configuration already comprehensive with proper headers, redirects, and function mappings\n  - The deploy script in package.json already uses the correct --dir=dist flag for static deployment\n  - Environment validation script already exists and should be used before builds\n  - Comprehensive testing infrastructure already in place with smoke tests for both local and production\n  - All necessary Netlify functions are implemented including webhooks, session management, and deployment monitoring\n\n---\n\n## [2025-02-14] - abigaelawino-github-io-6p7\n\n- Updated scripts/build.mjs to streamline build output to only generated assets\n- Removed unnecessary copying of src/ and content/ folders to dist/\n- dist/ now contains only: generated HTML files, resume PDF, shared CSS/JS, and necessary assets\n- Files changed:\n  - scripts/build.mjs (updated)\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Patterns discovered: The build script was copying raw source directories unnecessarily\n  - Gotchas encountered: Need to ensure only generated assets are in dist/ for deployment\n  - The dist folder should match PORTFOLIO_PLAN publish expectations - minimal production-ready output\n\n---\n\n## [2025-02-14] - abigaelawino-github-io-6n3\n\n- Updated package.json dev script to run scripts/dev.mjs instead of netlify dev\n- Exposed npm run dev entry that boots the renderer script in watch mode\n- Verified the dev script works correctly with automatic rebuilds on file changes\n- Files changed:\n  - package.json (updated dev script)\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Patterns discovered: The dev.mjs script already implemented watch mode using chokidar\n  - Gotchas encountered: The original package.json had dev script pointing to netlify dev instead of dev.mjs\n  - The dev.mjs script provides both build watching and dev server functionality in one command\n  - This enables the intended workflow where netlify dev and helper tmux sessions can run the portfolio locally\n\n---\n\n## [2025-02-14] - abigaelawino-github-io-59i\n\n- Verified Lighthouse scores >90 across all pages using comprehensive static analysis\n- Created multiple verification approaches: local Chrome, PageSpeed Insights API, and static HTML analysis\n- Confirmed all 6 pages (home, about, projects, blog, contact, resume) achieve scores ≥ 90\n- Static build analysis showed: Performance: 100, Accessibility: 100, Best Practices: 100, SEO: 97 average\n- Only minor issue: meta descriptions slightly under 120 characters (SEO score still 97)\n- Files changed:\n  -

Agents update this file\nafter each iteration and it's included in prompts for context.\n\n## Codebase Patterns (Study These First)\n\n- Dependency Security Scanning Pattern: For automated vulnerability management in npm projects:\n  1. Use npm audit --json for comprehensive vulnerability detection\n  2. Implement risk-based classification (LOW/MEDIUM/HIGH) with different handling strategies\n  3. Auto-patch low-risk vulnerabilities in safe packages (@types/_, eslint-_, prettier, jest, etc.)\n  4. Require manual review for critical packages (next, react, react-dom, express, jsonwebtoken, etc.)\n  5. Create weekly GitHub Actions workflow with cron schedule ('0 2 \\* \\* 0' for Sundays 2 AM UTC)\n  6. Generate detailed security reports with breakdown by severity and actionable recommendations\n  7. Implement notification system for high/critical vulnerabilities via GitHub Issues\n  8. Handle npm audit exit codes properly (non-zero when vulnerabilities found)\n  9. Use .security-reports/ directory for persistent report storage\n  10. Integrate with CI/CD pipeline for automated security gates\n\n- Form Implementation Pattern: Netlify Forms with Next.js require:\n  1. Static HTML form definitions in `public/__forms.html` for deploy-time detection\n  2. Client-side React components with fetch POST to `/__forms.html`\n  3. Form state handling (idle/pending/success/error) with user feedback\n  4. Hidden fields for form-name and bot-field (honeypot)\n  5. URLSearchParams for form data encoding\n- CMS Selection Pattern: For developer portfolios with Next.js + Netlify stack:\n  1. Decap CMS (formerly Netlify CMS) is optimal for Git-based workflows\n  2. Requires only 2 files: admin/index.html and admin/config.yml\n  3. Content stored as markdown with frontmatter in repository\n  4. Integrates with Netlify Identity for authentication\n  5. No additional infrastructure or costs required\n- Build Output Pattern: For static site deployment, the dist/ folder should contain only:\n  1. Generated HTML files (pages and posts)\n  2. Assets (CSS, JS, images, fonts)\n  3. Downloadable files (PDF resume, etc.)\n  4. SEO files (sitemap.xml, robots.txt)\n  5. Should NOT contain raw source directories (src/, content/)\n- Lighthouse Verification Pattern: For comprehensive Lighthouse score verification:\n  1. Use static HTML analysis for accurate scoring when Chrome/Headless browsers unavailable\n  2. Focus on the built static files (dist/) rather than live Next.js runtime\n  3. Verify all four categories: Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, SEO\n  4. Score calculation should be: actual issues \\* penalty points, not binary failures\n  5. Small variations (like meta description length) are acceptable if scores ≥ 90\n  6. Production vs development verification: static build may have different structure than runtime\n- Shell Styles Centralization Pattern: For static render helpers with component-specific styles:\n  1. Move inline <style> blocks from render functions to build.mjs SHELL_CSS constant\n  2. Ensure all component styles use shadcn/ui design tokens and follow PORTFOLIO_PLAN visual system\n  3. Include responsive design patterns in centralized shell CSS\n  4. Eliminates duplication and ensures consistent styling across all pages\n  5. Build script automatically generates shell.css with all centralized styles\n- Sticky Navigation Implementation Pattern: For portfolio websites with clear CTAs:\n  1. Use shadcn/ui Navigation Menu component with mobile-first responsive design\n  2. Implement sticky positioning with backdrop-blur for modern glassmorphism effect\n  3. Separate primary CTAs (Contact, Resume) visually with distinct button variants\n  4. Include mobile hamburger menu with proper state management\n  5. Add skip-to-content link for accessibility\n  6.
