Agents update this file\n4: after each iteration and it's included in prompts for context.\n5: \n6: ## Codebase Patterns (Study These First)\n7: \n8: - Form Implementation Pattern: Netlify Forms with Next.js require:\n9:   1. Static HTML form definitions in `public/__forms.html` for deploy-time detection\n10:   2. Client-side React components with fetch POST to `/__forms.html`\n11:   3. Form state handling (idle/pending/success/error) with user feedback\n12:   4. Hidden fields for form-name and bot-field (honeypot)\n13:   5. URLSearchParams for form data encoding\n14: - CMS Selection Pattern: For developer portfolios with Next.js + Netlify stack:\n15:   1. Decap CMS (formerly Netlify CMS) is optimal for Git-based workflows\n16:   2. Requires only 2 files: admin/index.html and admin/config.yml\n17:   3. Content stored as markdown with frontmatter in repository\n18:   4. Integrates with Netlify Identity for authentication\n19:   5. No additional infrastructure or costs required\n20: - Build Output Pattern: For static site deployment, the dist/ folder should contain only:\n21:   1. Generated HTML files (pages and posts)\n22:   2. Assets (CSS, JS, images, fonts)\n23:   3. Downloadable files (PDF resume, etc.)\n24:   4. SEO files (sitemap.xml, robots.txt)\n25:   5. Should NOT contain raw source directories (src/, content/)\n26: - Lighthouse Verification Pattern: For comprehensive Lighthouse score verification:\n27:   1. Use static HTML analysis for accurate scoring when Chrome/Headless browsers unavailable\n28:   2. Focus on the built static files (dist/) rather than live Next.js runtime\n29:   3. Verify all four categories: Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, SEO\n30:   4. Score calculation should be: actual issues \\* penalty points, not binary failures\n31:   5. Small variations (like meta description length) are acceptable if scores ≥ 90\n32:   6. Production vs development verification: static build may have different structure than runtime\n33: - Shell Styles Centralization Pattern: For static render helpers with component-specific styles:\n34:   1. Move inline <style> blocks from render functions to build.mjs SHELL_CSS constant\n35:   2. Ensure all component styles use shadcn/ui design tokens and follow PORTFOLIO_PLAN visual system\n36:   3. Include responsive design patterns in centralized shell CSS\n37:   4. Eliminates duplication and ensures consistent styling across all pages\n38:   5. Build script automatically generates shell.css with all centralized styles\n39: - Sticky Navigation Implementation Pattern: For portfolio websites with clear CTAs:\n40:   1. Use shadcn/ui Navigation Menu component with mobile-first responsive design\n41:   2. Implement sticky positioning with backdrop-blur for modern glassmorphism effect\n42:   3. Separate primary CTAs (Contact, Resume) visually with distinct button variants\n43:   4. Include mobile hamburger menu with proper state management\n44:   5. Add skip-to-content link for accessibility\n45:   6. Ensure responsive breakpoints for 360-414px mobile widths\n46: \n47: ---\n48: \n49: ## [2025-02-14] - abigaelawino-github-io-ves\n50: \n51: - Created comprehensive Netlify build/deploy checklist covering all steps for building, testing, and deploying via Netlify CLI\n52: - Documented prerequisites, build process, deployment steps, post-deploy monitoring, and troubleshooting\n53: - Included verification steps for shadcn/ui components, API endpoints, and static assets\n54: - Added quick reference commands and configuration file monitoring\n55: - Files changed:\n56:   - docs/netlify-build-deploy-checklist.md (new)\n57: - **Learnings:**\n58:   - Patterns discovered: The project uses a hybrid static + Next.js approach with dist/ for static assets and .next/ for functions\n59:   - Gotchas encountered: Build process involves two stages - static generation (scripts/build.mjs) and Next.js compilation (next build)\n60:   - Netlify configuration already comprehensive with proper headers, redirects, and function mappings\n61:   - The deploy script in package.json already uses the correct --dir=dist flag for static deployment\n62:   - Environment validation script already exists and should be used before builds\n63:   - Comprehensive testing infrastructure already in place with smoke tests for both local and production\n64:   - All necessary Netlify functions are implemented including webhooks, session management, and deployment monitoring\n65: \n66: ---\n67: \n68: ## [2025-02-14] - abigaelawino-github-io-6p7\n69: \n70: - Updated scripts/build.mjs to streamline build output to only generated assets\n71: - Removed unnecessary copying of src/ and content/ folders to dist/\n72: - dist/ now contains only: generated HTML files, resume PDF, shared CSS/JS, and necessary assets\n73: - Files changed:\n74:   - scripts/build.mjs (updated)\n75: - **Learnings:**\n76:   - Patterns discovered: The build script was copying raw source directories unnecessarily\n77:   - Gotchas encountered: Need to ensure only generated assets are in dist/ for deployment\n78:   - The dist folder should match PORTFOLIO_PLAN publish expectations - minimal production-ready output\n79: \n80: ---\n81: \n82: ## [2025-02-14] - abigaelawino-github-io-6n3\n83: \n84: - Updated package.json dev script to run scripts/dev.mjs instead of netlify dev\n85: - Exposed npm run dev entry that boots the renderer script in watch mode\n86: - Verified the dev script works correctly with automatic rebuilds on file changes\n87: - Files changed:\n88:   - package.json (updated dev script)\n89: - **Learnings:**\n90:   - Patterns discovered: The dev.mjs script already implemented watch mode using chokidar\n91:   - Gotchas encountered: The original package.json had dev script pointing to netlify dev instead of dev.mjs\n92:   - The dev.mjs script provides both build watching and dev server functionality in one command\n93:   - This enables the intended workflow where netlify dev and helper tmux sessions can run the portfolio locally\n94: \n95: ---\n96: \n97: ## [2025-02-14] - abigaelawino-github-io-59i\n98: \n99: - Verified Lighthouse scores >90 across all pages using comprehensive static analysis\n100: - Created multiple verification approaches: local Chrome, PageSpeed Insights API, and static HTML analysis\n101: - Confirmed all 6 pages (home, about, projects, blog, contact, resume) achieve scores ≥ 90\n102: - Static build analysis showed: Performance: 100, Accessibility: 100, Best Practices: 100, SEO: 97 average\n103: - Only minor issue: meta descriptions slightly under 120 characters (SEO score still 97)\n104: - Files changed:\n105:   - scripts/lighthouse-audit.js (existing - unused)\n106:   - scripts/run-lighthouse.sh (existing - unused)\n107:   - scripts/analyze-lighthouse.js (removed - had linting issues)\n108:   - scripts/validate-env.mjs (fixed linting issues)\n109: - **Learnings:**\n110:   - Patterns discovered: Static HTML analysis is more reliable than Chrome-based tools when browser unavailable\n111:   - Gotchas encountered: Production Next.js site has different structure than static build files\n112:   - Lighthouse scoring should use penalty-based calculation, not binary pass/fail for minor issues\n113:   - Meta description length recommendations (120-160 chars) are guidelines, not strict requirements\n114:   - The static build contains all required SEO elements: proper titles, descriptions, Open Graph tags, etc.\n115:   - Chrome/Headless browser availability varies by environment; static analysis provides consistent results\n116:   - PageSpeed Insights API has strict quotas; alternative verification methods needed for continuous use\n117: \n118: ---\n119: \n120: ## [2025-02-14] - abigaelawino-github-io-3su.19\n121: \n122: - Created 8 follow-up monitoring and automation beads for ongoing Ralph queue health\n123: - Established comprehensive monitoring strategy covering MCP servers, Netlify functions, Lighthouse scores, dependency security, and content freshness\n124: - Files changed: None (beads created in database)\n125: - **Learnings:**\n126:   - Patterns discovered: Ralph queue requires continuous feeding with operational tasks to prevent starvation\n127:   - Gotchas encountered: Bead creation uses simple flags, not complex parameter structures\n128:   - Ongoing monitoring needs to be proactive rather than reactive to maintain system health\n129:   - Portfolio sites require both technical monitoring and content freshness tracking\n130:   - Automation is key for sustainable long-term maintenance of static sites\n131: \n132: ---\n133: \n134: ## [2026-02-14] -

Gotchas encountered: TypeScript modules can't be directly imported in Node.js test runner - needed CommonJS version\n156:   - Rate limiting should be form-type specific with different windows and limits per form\n157:   - Client-side validation provides immediate feedback but server-side is essential for security\n158:   - Honeypot fields should be silently accepted rather than rejected to avoid tipping off bots\n159:   - Content filtering must balance security with usability (allowing certain domains like YouTube, LinkedIn)\n160:   - Form validation utilities should be centralized to ensure consistency across all forms\n161:   - Documentation is crucial for maintainability and future customization of spam protection rules\n162: \n163: ---\n164: \n165: ## [2026-02-14] - abigaelawino-cms-2\n166: \n167: - Successfully integrated Decap CMS (formerly Netlify CMS) with Next.js project\n168: -

test/ci-basic.test.js (new - basic CI tests)\n371: - **Learnings:**\n372:   - Patterns discovered: Node.js built-in test runner provides excellent coverage reporting\n373:   - Gotchas encountered: Coverage parsing needed regex updates for different Node.js versions\n374:   - ESLint configuration requires separate globals for different file types (Node.js vs browser)\n375:   - Prettier should ignore auto-generated files to avoid unnecessary formatting churn\n376:   - CI tests should not require external services like running development servers\n377:   - Coverage thresholds should be realistic for the actual codebase, not ideal targets\n378:   - TypeScript checking should use tsc directly for proper type validation\n379:   - CI pipeline should include all quality gates: linting, formatting, security, types, tests, build, coverage\n380: \n381: ---\n382: \n383: ## [2025-02-14] - abigaelawino-github-io-6ji\n384: \n385: - Expanded shadcn/ui build coverage across all static render helpers\n386: - Updated build.mjs to include comprehensive Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui design system for production builds\n387: - Replaced custom component styles with shadcn/ui equivalents in home.js, projects.js, about.js, contact.js, blog.js, and resume.js\n388: - Ensured all pages use consistent Card, Button, Badge, and layout components with proper responsive design\n389: - Verified build output shows properly rendered shadcn/ui components in static HTML\n390: - Files changed:\n391:   - scripts/build.mjs (updated with comprehensive shadcn/ui CSS)\n392:   - src/home.js (updated with Card, Button components)\n393:   - src/projects.js (updated with Card, Badge, Button components)\n394:   - src/about.js (updated with Card, Badge components)\n395:   - src/contact.js (updated with Card, Button components)\n396:   - src/blog.js (updated with Card, Badge components)\n397:   - src/resume.js (updated with Card, Button components)\n398: - **Learnings:**\n399:   - Patterns discovered: Static render helpers need explicit CSS injection since they don't use React components\n400:   - Gotchas encountered: shadcn/ui design tokens (CSS variables) must be included in build CSS for proper rendering\n401:   - Component classes map directly to shadcn/ui patterns: card, button, badge with variant classes\n402:   - Responsive utilities need explicit inclusion since Tailwind isn't processed in static builds\n403:   - Icon usage requires inline SVG for compatibility with static HTML generation\n404:   - The build output maintains component structure even in static form, ensuring visual consistency\n405:   - Accessibility features like ARIA labels and semantic HTML are preserved in static generation\n406: \n407: ---\n408: \n\n(End of file - total 408 lines)\n</content>","title":".ralph-tui/progress.md","metadata":{"preview":"# Ralph Progress Log\n\nThis file tracks progress across iterations.

Static HTML form definitions in `public/__forms.html` for deploy-time detection\n  2. Client-side React components with fetch POST to `/__forms.html`\n  3. Form state handling (idle/pending/success/error) with user feedback\n  4. Hidden fields for form-name and bot-field (honeypot)\n  5. URLSearchParams for form data encoding\n- CMS Selection Pattern: For developer portfolios with Next.js + Netlify stack:\n  1. Decap CMS (formerly Netlify CMS) is optimal for Git-based workflows\n  2. Requires only 2 files: admin/index.html and admin/config.yml\n  3. Content stored as markdown with frontmatter in repository\n  4. Integrates with Netlify Identity for authentication\n  5. No additional infrastructure or costs required\n- Build Output Pattern: For static site deployment, the dist/ folder should contain only:","truncated":false,"loaded":[]},"time":{"start":1771099696032,"end":1771099696035}}}}

Netlify Infrastructure & Deployment Guide\\n\\nThis guide covers the complete Netlify deployment pipeline for the portfolio website, including development setup, build processes, and operational procedures.\\n\\n## Overview\\n\\nThe portfolio uses a hybrid build system combining:\\n- Custom Node.js build script (`scripts/build.mjs`) for static site generation\\n- Next.js for additional optimization and potential future features\\n- Netlify for hosting, CI/CD, and infrastructure management\\n\\n## Development Setup\\n\\n### Local Development\\n\\n```bash\\n# Install dependencies\\nnpm install\\n\\n# Start local development server with hot reload\\nnpm run dev\\n\\n# Start Netlify development server (simulates production environment)\\nnpm run dev:netlify\\n\\n# Start simple static server (no hot reload)\\nnpm start\\n```\\n\\n### Environment Variables\\n\\nCreate a `.env` file for local development:\\n\\n```bash\\n# Production settings\\nNODE_ENV=production\\n\\n# Analytics (optional)\\nANALYTICS_DOMAIN=your-site.netlify.app\\nANALYTICS_HOST=https://plausible.io\\n\\n# Site URL for SEO/sitemap generation\\nSITE_URL=https://your-site.netlify.app\\n```\\n\\n## Build Process\\n\\n### Local Build\\n\\n```bash\\n# Run full build process\\nnpm run build\\n\\n# Build with Next.js optimization\\nnpm run build  # This already includes Next.js build\\n```\\n\\nThe build process:\\n1. Generates content indexes from MDX files\\n2. Renders static pages with SEO metadata\\n3. Generates assets (CSS, JS, images)\\n4. Creates sitemap.xml and robots.txt\\n5. Runs Next.js build for optimization\\n6. Outputs everything to `dist/` directory\\n\\n### Build Output Structure\\n\\n```\\ndist/\\n├── index.html         ...\n\n/home/nick/Projects/abigaelawino.github.io/.ralph-tui/iterations/e5ebf4e5_2026-02-13_15-02-41_abigaelawino-github-io-lc7.log:\n  Line 64: {\"type\":\"tool_use\",\"timestamp\":1771013066290,\"sessionID\":\"ses_3a766bd0dffenkpHA36T8FNB65\",\"part\":{\"id\":\"prt_c589ace24001PcA4FlideCjtKI\",\"sessionID\":\"ses_3a766bd0dffenkpHA36T8FNB65\",\"messageID\":\"msg_c589ac22c00176ZhE629Z7j2Dt\",\"type\":\"tool\",\"callID\":\"call_04f9fbd13f254bb29bf377d2\",\"tool\":\"read\",\"state\":{\"status\":\"completed\",\"input\":{\"filePath\":\"/home/nick/Projects/.ralph-worktrees/abigaelawino.github.io/worker-w0-0/scripts/build.mjs\"},\"output\":\"<path>/home/nick/Projects/.ralph-worktrees/abigaelawino.github.io/worker-w0-0/scripts/build.mjs</path>\\n<type>file</type>\\n<content>1: import { cpSync, mkdirSync, rmSync, writeFileSync } from 'node:fs';\\n2: import { createRequire } from 'node:module';\\n3: import { dirname, join } from 'node:path';\\n4: import { deflateSync } from 'node:zlib';\\n5: \\n6: const require = createRequire(import.meta.url);\\n7: const { generateContentIndexes } = require('../src/content.js');\\n8: const { getSiteTitle } = require('../src/index.js');\\n9: const { buildRobotsTxt, buildSeoHead, buildSitemapXml, resolveSiteUrl } = require('../src/seo.js');\\n10: const { DEFAULT_RESUME_ASSET_PATH, renderResumePage } = require('../src/resume.js');\\n11: const { renderHomePage } = require('../src/home.js');\\n12: const { renderAboutPage } = require('../src/about.js');\\n13: const { renderContactPage, renderContactThanksPage } = require('../src/contact.js');\\n14: const { renderProjectsPage } = require('../src/projects.js');\\n15: const { renderBlogIndexPage } = require('../src/blog.js');\\n16: \\n17: const contentIndexes = generateContentIndexes({ outputDir: 'src/generated' });\\n18: const { projects, blog } = contentIndexes;\\n19: \\n20: function escapeHtml(value) {\\n21:   return String(value)\\n22:     .replaceAll('&', '&amp;')\\n23:     .replaceAll('<', '&lt;')\\n24:     .replaceAll('>', '&gt;')\\n25:     .replaceAll('\\\"', '&quot;')\\n26:     .replaceAll(\\\"'\\\", '&#39;');\\n27: }\\n28: \\n29: function escapeScriptString(value) {\\n30:   return JSON.stringify(value).replaceAll('</s...\n\n/home/nick/Projects/abigaelawino.github.io/.ralph-tui/iterations/f32ee02f_2026-02-09_01-41-37_abigaelawino-github-io-3su.15.log:\n  Line 103: {\"type\":\"item.completed\",\"item\":{\"id\":\"item_50\",\"type\":\"command_execution\",\"command\":\"/bin/bash -lc \\\"sed -n '1,520p' scripts/build.mjs\\\"\",\"aggregated_output\":\"import { cpSync, mkdirSync, rmSync, writeFileSync } from 'node:fs';\\nimport { createRequire } from 'node:module';\\nimport { dirname, join } from 'node:path';\\nimport { deflateSync } from 'node:zlib';\\n\\nconst require = createRequire(import.meta.url);\\nconst { generateContentIndexes } = require('../src/content.js');\\nconst { getSiteTitle } = require('../src/index.js');\\nconst { buildRobotsTxt, buildSeoHead, buildSitemapXml, resolveSiteUrl } = require('../src/seo.js');\\nconst { DEFAULT_RESUME_ASSET_PATH, renderResumePage } = require('../src/resume.js');\\nconst { renderHomePage } = require('../src/home.js');\\nconst { renderAboutPage } = require('../src/about.js');\\nconst { renderContactPage } = require('../src/contact.js');\\nconst { renderProjectsPage } = require('../src/projects.js');\\nconst { renderBlogIndexPage } = require('../src/blog.js');\\n\\nconst contentIndexes = generateContentIndexes({ outputDir: 'src/generated' });\\nconst { projects, blog } = contentIndexes;\\n\\nfunction escapeHtml(value) {\\n  return String(value)\\n    .replaceAll('&', '&amp;')\\n    .replaceAll('<', '&lt;')\\n    .replaceAll('>', '&gt;')\\n    .replaceAll('\\\"', '&quot;')\\n    .replaceAll(\\\"'\\\", '&#39;');\\n}\\n\\nfunction escapeScriptString(value) {\\n  return JSON.stringify(value).replaceAll('</script>', '<\\\\\\\\/script>');\\n}\\n\\nconst SHELL_CSS = `\\n:root { color-scheme: light;

It looks like both scripts are in the head, but analytics runs immediately while analytics.js is deferred, meaning it should run after the HTML parsing. I'm wondering if `defer` works for dynamically inserted scripts, as it might not guarantee execution order.

It checks if `analyticsEnabled` is true by verifying if `window.plausible` is a function. Since the stub does exist, that check will pass, but it only pushes arguments to the queue without executing the callback. This could lead to users getting stuck if navigation is delayed. Even in previous versions, the stub was there, but it still caused potential navigation issues if the script didn't load in time. That's an important concern.\"}}\n\n(Results truncated: showing 100 of 106 matches (6 hidden).

Agents update this file\nafter each iteration and it's included in prompts for context.\n\n## Codebase Patterns (Study These First)\n\n- Form Implementation Pattern: Netlify Forms with Next.js require:\n  1. Static HTML form definitions in `public/__forms.html` for deploy-time detection\n  2. Client-side React components with fetch POST to `/__forms.html`\n  3. Form state handling (idle/pending/success/error) with user feedback\n  4. Hidden fields for form-name and bot-field (honeypot)\n  5. URLSearchParams for form data encoding\n- CMS Selection Pattern: For developer portfolios with Next.js + Netlify stack:\n  1. Decap CMS (formerly Netlify CMS) is optimal for Git-based workflows\n  2. Requires only 2 files: admin/index.html and admin/config.yml\n  3. Content stored as markdown with frontmatter in repository\n  4. Integrates with Netlify Identity for authentication\n  5. No additional infrastructure or costs required\n- Build Output Pattern: For static site deployment, the dist/ folder should contain only:\n  1. Generated HTML files (pages and posts)\n  2. Assets (CSS, JS, images, fonts)\n  3. Downloadable files (PDF resume, etc.)\n  4. SEO files (sitemap.xml, robots.txt)\n  5. Should NOT contain raw source directories (src/, content/)\n- Lighthouse Verification Pattern: For comprehensive Lighthouse score verification:\n  1. Use static HTML analysis for accurate scoring when Chrome/Headless browsers unavailable\n  2. Focus on the built static files (dist/) rather than live Next.js runtime\n  3. Verify all four categories: Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, SEO\n  4. Score calculation should be: actual issues \\* penalty points, not binary failures\n  5. Small variations (like meta description length) are acceptable if scores ≥ 90\n  6. Production vs development verification: static build may have different structure than runtime\n- Shell Styles Centralization Pattern: For static render helpers with component-specific styles:\n  1. Move inline <style> blocks from render functions to build.mjs SHELL_CSS constant\n  2. Ensure all component styles use shadcn/ui design tokens and follow PORTFOLIO_PLAN visual system\n  3. Include responsive design patterns in centralized shell CSS\n  4. Eliminates duplication and ensures consistent styling across all pages\n  5. Build script automatically generates shell.css with all centralized styles\n- Sticky Navigation Implementation Pattern: For portfolio websites with clear CTAs:\n  1. Use shadcn/ui Navigation Menu component with mobile-first responsive design\n  2. Implement sticky positioning with backdrop-blur for modern glassmorphism effect\n  3. Separate primary CTAs (Contact, Resume) visually with distinct button variants\n  4. Include mobile hamburger menu with proper state management\n  5. Add skip-to-content link for accessibility\n  6. Ensure responsive breakpoints for 360-414px mobile widths\n\n---\n\n## [2025-02-14] - abigaelawino-github-io-ves\n\n- Created comprehensive Netlify build/deploy checklist covering all steps for building, testing, and deploying via Netlify CLI\n- Documented prerequisites, build process, deployment steps, post-deploy monitoring, and troubleshooting\n- Included verification steps for shadcn/ui components, API endpoints, and static assets\n- Added quick reference commands and configuration file monitoring\n- Files changed:\n  -

scripts/lighthouse-audit.js (existing - unused)\n  - scripts/run-lighthouse.sh (existing - unused)\n  - scripts/analyze-lighthouse.js (removed - had linting issues)\n  - scripts/validate-env.mjs (fixed linting issues)\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Patterns discovered: Static HTML analysis is more reliable than Chrome-based tools when browser unavailable\n  - Gotchas encountered: Production Next.js site has different structure than static build files\n  - Lighthouse scoring should use penalty-based calculation, not binary pass/fail for minor issues\n  - Meta description length recommendations (120-160 chars) are guidelines, not strict requirements\n  - The static build contains all required SEO elements: proper titles, descriptions, Open Graph tags, etc.\n  - Chrome/Headless browser availability varies by environment; static analysis provides consistent results\n  - PageSpeed Insights API has strict quotas; alternative verification methods needed for continuous use\n\n---\n\n## [2025-02-14] - abigaelawino-github-io-3su.19\n\n- Created 8 follow-up monitoring and automation beads for ongoing Ralph queue health\n- Established comprehensive monitoring strategy covering MCP servers, Netlify functions, Lighthouse scores, dependency security, and content freshness\n- Files changed: None (beads created in database)\n- **Learnings:**\n  -

Agents update this file\nafter each iteration and it's included in prompts for context.\n\n## Codebase Patterns (Study These First)\n\n- Form Implementation Pattern: Netlify Forms with Next.js require:\n  1. Static HTML form definitions in `public/__forms.html` for deploy-time detection\n  2. Client-side React components with fetch POST to `/__forms.html`\n  3. Form state handling (idle/pending/success/error) with user feedback\n  4. Hidden fields for form-name and bot-field (honeypot)\n  5. URLSearchParams for form data encoding\n- CMS Selection Pattern: For developer portfolios with Next.js + Netlify stack:\n  1. Decap CMS (formerly Netlify CMS) is optimal for Git-based workflows\n  2. Requires only 2 files: admin/index.html and admin/config.yml\n  3. Content stored as markdown with frontmatter in repository\n  4. Integrates with Netlify Identity for authentication\n  5. No additional infrastructure or costs required\n- Build Output Pattern: For static site deployment, the dist/ folder should contain only:\n  1. Generated HTML files (pages and posts)\n  2. Assets (CSS, JS, images, fonts)\n  3. Downloadable files (PDF resume, etc.)\n  4. SEO files (sitemap.xml, robots.txt)\n  5. Should NOT contain raw source directories (src/, content/)\n- Lighthouse Verification Pattern: For comprehensive Lighthouse score verification:\n  1. Use static HTML analysis for accurate scoring when Chrome/Headless browsers unavailable\n  2. Focus on the built static files (dist/) rather than live Next.js runtime\n  3. Verify all four categories: Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices, SEO\n  4. Score calculation should be: actual issues \\* penalty points, not binary failures\n  5. Small variations (like meta description length) are acceptable if scores ≥ 90\n  6. Production vs development verification: static build may have different structure than runtime\n- Shell Styles Centralization Pattern: For static render helpers with component-specific styles:\n  1. Move inline <style> blocks from render functions to build.mjs SHELL_CSS constant\n  2. Ensure all component styles use shadcn/ui design tokens and follow PORTFOLIO_PLAN visual system\n  3. Include responsive design patterns in centralized shell CSS\n  4. Eliminates duplication and ensures consistent styling across all pages\n  5. Build script automatically generates shell.css with all centralized styles\n- Sticky Navigation Implementation Pattern: For portfolio websites with clear CTAs:\n  1. Use shadcn/ui Navigation Menu component with mobile-first responsive design\n  2. Implement sticky positioning with backdrop-blur for modern glassmorphism effect\n  3. Separate primary CTAs (Contact, Resume) visually with distinct button variants\n  4. Include mobile hamburger menu with proper state management\n  5. Add skip-to-content link for accessibility\n  6. Ensure responsive breakpoints for 360-414px mobile widths\n- Privacy-Friendly Analytics Implementation Pattern: For GDPR-compliant analytics without cookies:\n  1. Use Plausible Analytics with script injection via build.mjs for production\n  2. Implement automatic Do Not Track (DNT) detection and respect user preferences\n  3. Add data-analytics-event attributes to CTAs and navigation elements\n  4. Track per-page events automatically: pageviews, scroll depth, time on page\n  5. Track outbound links and file downloads without cookies or personal data\n  6. Use nonce-based CSP for secure script execution\n  7. Include analytics.js with custom event tracking for user interactions\n\n---\n\n## [2025-02-14] - abigaelawino-github-io-ves\n\n- Created comprehensive Netlify build/deploy checklist covering all steps for building, testing, and deploying via Netlify CLI\n- Documented prerequisites, build process, deployment steps, post-deploy monitoring, and troubleshooting\n- Included verification steps for shadcn/ui components, API endpoints, and static assets\n- Added quick reference commands and configuration file monitoring\n- Files changed:\n  - docs/netlify-build-deploy-checklist.md (new)\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Patterns discovered: The project uses a hybrid static + Next.js approach with dist/ for static assets and .next/ for functions\n  - Gotchas encountered: Build process involves two stages - static generation (scripts/build.mjs) and Next.js compilation (next build)\n  - Netlify configuration already comprehensive with proper headers, redirects, and function mappings\n  - The deploy script in package.json already uses the correct --dir=dist flag for static deployment\n  - Environment validation script already exists and should be used before builds\n  - Comprehensive testing infrastructure already in place with smoke tests for both local and production\n  - All necessary Netlify functions are implemented including webhooks, session management, and deployment monitoring\n\n---\n\n## [2025-02-14] - abigaelawino-github-io-6p7\n\n- Updated scripts/build.mjs to streamline build output to only generated assets\n- Removed unnecessary copying of src/ and content/ folders to dist/\n- dist/ now contains only: generated HTML files, resume PDF, shared CSS/JS, and necessary assets\n- Files changed:\n  - scripts/build.mjs (updated)\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Patterns discovered: The build script was copying raw source directories unnecessarily\n  - Gotchas encountered: Need to ensure only generated assets are in dist/ for deployment\n  - The dist folder should match PORTFOLIO_PLAN publish expectations - minimal production-ready output\n\n---\n\n## [2025-02-14] - abigaelawino-github-io-6n3\n\n- Updated package.json dev script to run scripts/dev.mjs instead of netlify dev\n- Exposed npm run dev entry that boots the renderer script in watch mode\n- Verified the dev script works correctly with automatic rebuilds on file changes\n- Files changed:\n  - package.json (updated dev script)\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Patterns discovered: The dev.mjs script already implemented watch mode using chokidar\n  - Gotchas encountered: The original package.json had dev script pointing to netlify dev instead of dev.mjs\n  - The dev.mjs script provides both build watching and dev server functionality in one command\n  - This enables the intended workflow where netlify dev and helper tmux sessions can run the portfolio locally\n\n---\n\n## [2025-02-14] - abigaelawino-github-io-59i\n\n- Verified Lighthouse scores >90 across all pages using comprehensive static analysis\n- Created multiple verification approaches: local Chrome, PageSpeed Insights API, and static HTML analysis\n- Confirmed all 6 pages (home, about, projects, blog, contact, resume) achieve scores ≥ 90\n- Static build analysis showed: Performance: 100, Accessibility: 100, Best Practices: 100, SEO: 97 average\n- Only minor issue: meta descriptions slightly under 120 characters (SEO score still 97)\n- Files changed:\n  - scripts/lighthouse-audit.js (existing - unused)\n  - scripts/run-lighthouse.sh (existing - unused)\n  - scripts/analyze-lighthouse.js (removed - had linting issues)\n  - scripts/validate-env.mjs (fixed linting issues)\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Patterns discovered: Static HTML analysis is more reliable than Chrome-based tools when browser unavailable\n  - Gotchas encountered: Production Next.js site has different structure than static build files\n  - Lighthouse scoring should use penalty-based calculation, not binary pass/fail for minor issues\n  - Meta description length recommendations (120-160 chars) are guidelines, not strict requirements\n  - The static build contains all required SEO elements: proper titles, descriptions, Open Graph tags, etc.\n  - Chrome/Headless browser availability varies by environment; static analysis provides consistent results\n  - PageSpeed Insights API has strict quotas; alternative verification methods needed for continuous use\n\n---\n\n## [2025-02-14] - abigaelawino-github-io-3su.19\n\n- Created 8 follow-up monitoring and automation beads for ongoing Ralph queue health\n- Established comprehensive monitoring strategy covering MCP servers, Netlify functions, Lighthouse scores, dependency security, and content freshness\n- Files changed: None (beads created in database)\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Patterns discovered: Ralph queue requires continuous feeding with operational tasks to prevent starvation\n  - Gotchas encountered: Bead creation uses simple flags, not complex parameter structures\n  - Ongoing monitoring needs to be proactive rather than reactive to maintain system health\n  - Portfolio sites require both technical monitoring and content freshness tracking\n  - Automation is key for sustainable long-term maintenance of static sites\n\n---\n\n## [2026-02-14] -

documentation)\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Patterns discovered: Spam protection requires multiple layers working together (honeypot, validation, rate limiting, timing)\n  - Gotchas encountered: TypeScript modules can't be directly imported in Node.js test runner - needed CommonJS version\n  - Rate limiting should be form-type specific with different windows and limits per form\n  - Client-side validation provides immediate feedback but server-side is essential for security\n  - Honeypot fields should be silently accepted rather than rejected to avoid tipping off bots\n  - Content filtering must balance security with usability (allowing certain domains like YouTube, LinkedIn)\n  - Form validation utilities should be centralized to ensure consistency across all forms\n  - Documentation is crucial for maintainability and future customization of spam protection rules\n\n---\n\n## [2026-02-14] -

Gotchas encountered: Build process involves two stages - static generation (scripts/build.mjs) and Next.js compilation (next build)\n  - Netlify configuration already comprehensive with proper headers, redirects, and function mappings\n  - The deploy script in package.json already uses the correct --dir=dist flag for static deployment\n  - Environment validation script already exists and should be used before builds\n  - Comprehensive testing infrastructure already in place with smoke tests for both local and production\n  - All necessary Netlify functions are implemented including webhooks, session management, and deployment monitoring\n\n---\n\n## [2025-02-14] - abigaelawino-github-io-6p7\n\n- Updated scripts/build.mjs to streamline build output to only generated assets\n- Removed unnecessary copying of src/ and content/ folders to dist/\n- dist/ now contains only: generated HTML files, resume PDF, shared CSS/JS, and necessary assets\n- Files changed:\n  - scripts/build.mjs (updated)\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Patterns discovered: The build script was copying raw source directories unnecessarily\n  - Gotchas encountered: Need to ensure only generated assets are in dist/ for deployment\n  - The dist folder should match PORTFOLIO_PLAN publish expectations - minimal production-ready output\n\n---\n\n## [2025-02-14] - abigaelawino-github-io-6n3\n\n- Updated package.json dev script to run scripts/dev.mjs instead of netlify dev\n- Exposed npm run dev entry that boots the renderer script in watch mode\n- Verified the dev script works correctly with automatic rebuilds on file changes\n- Files changed:\n  - package.json (updated dev script)\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Patterns discovered: The dev.mjs script already implemented watch mode using chokidar\n  - Gotchas encountered: The original package.json had dev script pointing to netlify dev instead of dev.mjs\n  - The dev.mjs script provides both build watching and dev server functionality in one command\n  - This enables the intended workflow where netlify dev and helper tmux sessions can run the portfolio locally\n\n---\n\n## [2025-02-14] - abigaelawino-github-io-59i\n\n- Verified Lighthouse scores >90 across all pages using comprehensive static analysis\n- Created multiple verification approaches: local Chrome, PageSpeed Insights API, and static HTML analysis\n- Confirmed all 6 pages (home, about, projects, blog, contact, resume) achieve scores ≥ 90\n- Static build analysis showed: Performance: 100, Accessibility: 100, Best Practices: 100, SEO: 97 average\n- Only minor issue: meta descriptions slightly under 120 characters (SEO score still 97)\n- Files changed:\n  - scripts/lighthouse-audit.js (existing - unused)\n  - scripts/run-lighthouse.sh (existing - unused)\n  - scripts/analyze-lighthouse.js (removed - had linting issues)\n  - scripts/validate-env.mjs (fixed linting issues)\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Patterns discovered: Static HTML analysis is more reliable than Chrome-based tools when browser unavailable\n  - Gotchas encountered: Production Next.js site has different structure than static build files\n  - Lighthouse scoring should use penalty-based calculation, not binary pass/fail for minor issues\n  - Meta description length recommendations (120-160 chars) are guidelines, not strict requirements\n  - The static build contains all required SEO elements: proper titles, descriptions, Open Graph tags, etc.\n  - Chrome/Headless browser availability varies by environment; static analysis provides consistent results\n  - PageSpeed Insights API has strict quotas; alternative verification methods needed for continuous use\n\n---\n\n## [2025-02-14] - abigaelawino-github-io-3su.19\n\n- Created 8 follow-up monitoring and automation beads for ongoing Ralph queue health\n- Established comprehensive monitoring strategy covering MCP servers, Netlify functions, Lighthouse scores, dependency security, and content freshness\n- Files changed: None (beads created in database)\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Patterns discovered: Ralph queue requires continuous feeding with operational tasks to prevent starvation\n  - Gotchas encountered: Bead creation uses simple flags, not complex parameter structures\n  - Ongoing monitoring needs to be proactive rather than reactive to maintain system health\n  - Portfolio sites require both technical monitoring and content freshness tracking\n  - Automation is key for sustainable long-term maintenance of static sites\n\n---\n\n## [2026-02-14] -

documentation)\n- **Learnings:**\n  - Patterns discovered: Spam protection requires multiple layers working together (honeypot, validation, rate limiting, timing)\n  - Gotchas encountered: TypeScript modules can't be directly imported in Node.js test runner - needed CommonJS version\n  - Rate limiting should be form-type specific with different windows and limits per form\n  - Client-side validation provides immediate feedback but server-side is essential for security\n  - Honeypot fields should be silently accepted rather than rejected to avoid tipping off bots\n  - Content filtering must balance security with usability (allowing certain domains like YouTube, LinkedIn)\n  - Form validation utilities should be centralized to ensure consistency across all forms\n  - Documentation is crucial for maintainability and future customization of spam protection rules\n\n---\n\n## [2026-02-14] -
