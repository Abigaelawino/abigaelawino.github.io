The goal was a single, tidy table that could drive both Python analysis and Tableau dashboards without manual fixes.\n\n## Source Files\n\n- 145 SSA text files (1880–2024)\n- Fields: name, sex, count, year\n- Minimum count per name-year enforced by SSA source\n\n## Core Cleaning Decisions\n\n- Concatenated all yearly files into one dataset\n- Standardized column names and data types\n- Validated categorical values for `sex` (F, M)\n- Ensured no missing values across core fields\n\n## Output Snapshot\n\n- **Rows:** 2,149,477\n- **Years:** 1880–2024\n- **Nulls:** 0 missing across core fields\n\n## Why This Matters for Viz\n\nOnce the data was flat and consistent, it became trivial to generate:\n\n- Year-over-year birth counts\n- Generation-based top-10 lists\n- Gender split comparisons\n\nIf you want to reproduce the pipeline, the notebook in the repo walks through every step and includes the final CSV export."

Rather than highlight one-year spikes, I used the full historical counts to avoid noisy conclusions.\n\n## Balanced Names (Top Examples)\n\n- Jessie (F: 169,704 | M: 111,202)\n- Riley (F: 137,477 | M: 103,344)\n- Casey (F: 77,869 | M: 115,589)\n- Jackie (F: 91,167 | M: 78,836)\n- Johnnie (F: 49,154 | M: 102,028)\n\n## Chart Rationale\n\nI used a grouped bar chart to show female vs male totals side-by-side. It keeps the comparison immediate and avoids confusion when the gap is narrow.\n\n## What I’d Add Next\n\n- Highlight shifts in balance over time (e.g., when a name flips gender dominance)\n- Add regional filters to see localized patterns"

This keeps the slide deck tight without burying assumptions.\n\n## Outcome\n\nThis structure let non-technical stakeholders validate the story quickly and still gave analysts enough detail to trust the results."

The lack of a pre-event slope shift supported the DiD setup.\n\n## Placebo Test\n\nI shifted the event date one week earlier and re-estimated the model. The placebo interaction was effectively zero (`treated_post ≈ 0.0042`), which increases confidence that the real event drove the observed effect.\n\n## Takeaway\n\nThe strongest evidence still comes from the main DiD interaction (`treated_post ≈ -0.0951`), but the placebo check and trend test make the story defensible."
