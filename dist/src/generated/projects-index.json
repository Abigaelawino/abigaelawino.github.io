    "caseStudyData": "Combined 24 months of CRM activity, subscription transactions, and support logs; standardized IDs and imputed sparse engagement fields before modeling.",
    "caseStudyMethods": "Trained gradient-boosted trees with recency-frequency features, compared against logistic regression baseline, and tuned thresholding for retention team capacity.",
    "caseStudyResults": "Improved top-decile churn capture by 31 percent over baseline and reduced wasted outreach by focusing account-manager effort on high-risk cohorts.",
    "caseStudyReproducibility": "Repository includes pinned dependencies, SQL feature extraction scripts, and notebook-to-pipeline parity checks for repeatable training runs.",
    "caseStudyReflection": "Next iteration should add causal uplift testing to separate true intervention impact from naturally reactivating customers.",

    "caseStudyResults": "Lowered weekly MAPE from 14.8 percent to 9.6 percent and gave finance partners two extra planning days through automated refresh workflows.",
