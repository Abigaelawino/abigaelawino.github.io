summary: Built an executive dashboard with rolling forecasts and anomaly alerts for weekly revenue planning.
caseStudyData: Aggregated store-level daily sales, promotions, and holiday calendars across 180 locations, then corrected late-arriving records with a weekly reconciliation job.
caseStudyMethods: Benchmarked Prophet against seasonal naive and gradient boosting regressors, then shipped the best-performing ensemble with confidence interval monitoring.
caseStudyResults: Lowered weekly MAPE from 14.8 percent to 9.6 percent and gave finance partners two extra planning days through automated refresh workflows.
caseStudyReproducibility: Repo documents data contracts, environment setup, and one-command pipeline execution to rebuild forecasts and dashboard extracts from raw tables.
caseStudyReflection: Future work should incorporate price elasticity features and scenario simulation for promotion-heavy periods.
