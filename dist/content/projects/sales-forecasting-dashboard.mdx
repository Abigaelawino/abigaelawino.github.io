title: Retail Sales Forecasting Dashboard
date: 2025-11-03
tags: [analytics, visualization, time-series]
summary: Built an executive dashboard with rolling forecasts and anomaly alerts for weekly revenue planning across 180 retail locations.
caseStudyData: Consolidated 3 years of store-level daily sales data (50M+ transactions), promotional calendars, seasonal events, and local economic indicators across 180 retail locations. Implemented comprehensive data quality pipeline handling late-arriving records, store reclassifications, and system outages. Created derived features including lag variables, rolling averages, promotional impact coefficients, and holiday effects. Performed extensive exploratory analysis identifying seasonal patterns, store clusters, and promotion effectiveness at regional levels.
caseStudyMethods: Benchmarked multiple forecasting approaches including Prophet, seasonal naive baseline, and gradient boosting regressors (LightGBM). Developed ensemble model combining Prophet's strength in capturing holidays and seasonality with gradient boosting's ability to model complex promotional effects. Implemented cross-validation with rolling windows to avoid look-ahead bias. Added automated anomaly detection using statistical process control charts and isolation forests. Created confidence interval monitoring to flag forecasts requiring human review.
caseStudyResults: Achieved 9.6% weekly MAPE (improvement from 14.8% baseline) with 95% of predictions within 15% of actual values. Reduced forecast preparation time from 3 days to 4 hours through automation. Identified $4.2M in promotional inefficiencies through anomaly detection and provided finance partners with two extra planning days per week. Dashboard adoption reached 92% among regional managers with average daily usage time of 45 minutes per user.
caseStudyReproducibility: Complete end-to-end reproducible pipeline with Dockerized environment and comprehensive data contracts defining source schemas, transformation rules, and quality checks. One-command execution recreates all forecasts from raw source tables through cleaned features to final dashboard extracts. Includes automated testing suite covering data validation, model performance checks, and dashboard functionality. Version-controlled configuration files enable reproducible scenario analysis and model comparisons.
caseStudyReflection: The project highlighted the critical balance between forecast accuracy and business usability. Initial complex models were accurate but difficult for business users to understand and trust. Simplified ensemble approach with clear explainability features achieved better adoption. Future iterations should incorporate price elasticity features and scenario simulation for promotion-heavy periods. Key learning was the importance of involving business stakeholders early in feature selection to ensure forecasts aligned with operational decision-making processes.

# Retail Sales Forecasting Dashboard

This case study demonstrates the development of a comprehensive retail sales forecasting system that combines advanced time series modeling with interactive dashboarding to support executive decision-making across a multi-location retail operation.

## Business Challenge

The retail organization was struggling with manual forecasting processes that took 3 days each week, often producing inconsistent results across different regional teams. Finance and operations needed more accurate, timely forecasts for inventory planning, staffing, and cash flow management. The existing process relied heavily on Excel models with limited ability to incorporate complex factors like promotions, seasonality, and local events.

## Technical Innovation

- **Multi-Model Ensemble**: Combined Prophet's seasonal decomposition with gradient boosting for promotional impact modeling
- **Automated Data Quality Pipeline**: Built robust ETL with automatic detection and correction of data anomalies
- **Business-Driven Feature Engineering**: Created interpretable features aligned with retail decision-making processes
- **Real-time Anomaly Detection**: Implemented statistical process control for immediate identification of unusual patterns

## Organizational Impact

Beyond the accuracy improvements, the dashboard transformed how the organization approaches sales planning. Regional teams now collaborate using shared assumptions, finance has better visibility into expected performance, and promotional planning is more data-driven. The system created a single source of truth that reduced conflicts between departments and improved overall planning efficiency.
