title: Customer Churn Risk Modeling
date: 2026-01-12
tags: [ml, analytics, time-series]
summary: Built a churn risk model and dashboard to prioritize retention outreach for B2B SaaS customers.
caseStudyData: Combined 24 months of CRM activity, subscription transactions, and support logs for 10,000+ customers. Performed extensive data cleaning including standardizing customer IDs across systems, handling missing engagement metrics through multiple imputation, and creating temporal features to capture usage trends over time.
caseStudyMethods: Trained gradient-boosted trees (XGBoost) with recency-frequency-monetary (RFM) features, including login frequency, feature usage patterns, support ticket history, and payment behavior. Compared against logistic regression baseline using AUC-ROC and precision-recall metrics. Implemented cost-sensitive learning to account for different retention costs across customer segments and tuned classification thresholds based on retention team capacity constraints.
caseStudyResults: Achieved 0.84 AUC-ROC (compared to 0.71 baseline) and improved top-decile churn capture by 31% over existing heuristic approach. The model reduced wasted outreach by 47% by focusing account manager effort on high-risk cohorts. Dashboard enabled proactive retention campaigns that saved an estimated $2.3M in ARR over 6 months through targeted interventions.
caseStudyReproducibility: Repository includes complete reproducible pipeline with pinned dependencies via requirements.txt, SQL feature extraction scripts with proper data lineage tracking, and Jupyter notebooks with parity checks to ensure production model matches training results. Docker environment provided for consistent reproducibility across development and production environments.
caseStudyReflection: The biggest challenge was balancing model accuracy with operational constraints of the retention team. Next iteration should incorporate causal uplift testing to separate true intervention impact from naturally reactivating customers, and explore multi-armed bandit approaches for retention offer optimization. Also learned the importance of early collaboration with business stakeholders to define success metrics aligned with operational capabilities.

# Customer Churn Risk Modeling

This case study demonstrates the end-to-end development of a machine learning system to predict customer churn for a B2B SaaS company, from data ingestion and feature engineering through model deployment and business impact measurement.

## Key Challenges Addressed

- **Fragmented Data Sources**: Customer data scattered across CRM, billing, and support systems with inconsistent identifiers
- **Class Imbalance**: Only 12% monthly churn rate requiring specialized modeling approaches
- **Operational Constraints**: Limited retention team capacity requiring precise targeting
- **Business Alignment**: Need for interpretable model features trusted by customer success teams

## Technical Architecture

The solution deployed a comprehensive ML pipeline with automated feature engineering, model training with cross-validation, and real-time scoring integrated into the company's CRM dashboard. The system processes daily batch updates and provides risk scores for all active customers with confidence intervals.
